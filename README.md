# Offensive Cyber Assistant

## Project Description

The Offensive Cyber Assistant project develops a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Model (LLM) that is designed specifically for offensive cybersecurity professionals such as red teamers and penetration testers. This model leverages advanced language processing to provide insights into vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited in various systems.

By using the RAG LLM, security professionals can:

- **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Gain insights into potential vulnerabilities within a given system or application.
- **Understand Exploits:** Receive detailed information on known exploits and how they can be leveraged in penetration testing scenarios.
- **Enhance Red Team Exercises:** Utilize the model to simulate attacks and assess security measures effectively.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with the latest threat vectors and security practices to enhance overall cybersecurity strategies.

The RAG LLM combines up-to-date knowledge with powerful analysis capabilities to support proactive security measures and improve the effectiveness of security assessments.
