They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.[1][2][3][4]In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or tagged with specific file markers). Adversaries may need to first employ other behaviors, such asFile and Directory Permissions ModificationorSystem Shutdown/Reboot, in order to unlock and/or gain access to manipulate these files.[5]In some cases, adversaries may encrypt critical system files, disk partitions, and the MBR.[3]To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for encrypting data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other attack techniques likeValid Accounts,OS Credential Dumping, andSMB/Windows Admin Shares.[2][3]Encryption malware may also leverageInternal Defacement, such as changing victim wallpapers, or otherwise intimidate victims by sending ransom notes or other messages to connected printers (known as "print bombing").[6]In cloud environments, storage objects within compromised accounts may also be encrypted.[7]ID:T1486Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityContributors:ExtraHop; Harshal Tupsamudre, Qualys; Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; Oleg Kolesnikov, Securonix; Travis Smith, QualysVersion:1.4Created:15 March 2019Last Modified:16 June 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1129AkiraAkiraencrypts victim filesystems for financial extortion purposes.[8]G1024AkiraAkiraencrypts files in victim environments as part of ransomware operations.[9]G0082APT38APT38has used Hermes ransomware to encrypt files with AES256.[10]G0096APT41APT41used a ransomware called Encryptor RaaS to encrypt files on the targeted systems and provide a ransom note to the user.[11]S0640AvaddonAvaddonencrypts the victim system using a combination of AES256 and RSA encryption schemes.[12]S1053AvosLockerAvosLockerhas encrypted files and network resources using AES-256 and added an.avos,.avos2, or.AvosLinuxextension to filenames.[13][14][15][16]S0638BabukBabukcan use ChaCha8 and ECDH to encrypt data.[17][18][19][20]S0606Bad RabbitBad Rabbithas encrypted files and disks using AES-128-CBC and RSA-2048.[21]S0570BitPaymerBitPaymercan import a hard-coded RSA 1024-bit public key, generate a 128-bit RC4 key for each file, and encrypt the file in place, appending.lockedto the filename.[22]S1070Black BastaBlack Bastacan encrypt files with the ChaCha20 cypher and using a multithreaded process to increase speed.[23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31]S1068BlackCatBlackCathas the ability to encrypt Windows devices, Linux devices, and VMWare instances.[32]C0015C0015DuringC0015, the threat actors usedContiransomware to encrypt a compromised network.[33]C0018C0018DuringC0018, the threat actors usedAvosLockerransomware to encrypt files on the compromised network.[15][34]S1096CheerscryptCheerscryptcan encrypt data on victim machines using a Sosemanuk stream cipher with an Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) generated key.[35][36]S0611ClopClopcan encrypt files using AES, RSA, and RC4 and will add the ".clop" extension to encrypted files.[37][38][39]S0575ContiContican useCreateIoCompletionPort(),PostQueuedCompletionStatus(), andGetQueuedCompletionPort()to rapidly encrypt files, excluding those with the extensions of .exe, .dll, and .lnk.
