Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via thepython.exeinterpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.[1]Python comes with many built-in packages to interact with the underlying system, such as file operations and device I/O. Adversaries can use these libraries to download and execute commands or other scripts as well as perform various malicious behaviors.ID:T1059.006Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Python is installed.Version:1.0Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:30 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has developed malware variants written in Python.[2]G0067APT37APT37has used Python scripts to execute payloads.[3]G0087APT39APT39has used a command line utility and a network scanner written in python.[4][5]S0234BandookBandookcan support commands to execute Python-based payloads.[6]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas made use of Python-based remote access tools.[7]S0482BundloreBundlorehas used Python scripts to execute payloads.[8]S0631ChaesChaeshas used Python scripts for execution and the installation of additional files.[9]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas used a customized version of theImpacketwmiexec.py module to create renamed output files.[10]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan use Python to perform execution.[11][12][13][14]S0369CoinTickerCoinTickerexecutes a Python script to download its second stage.[15]S0492CookieMinerCookieMinerhas used python scripts on the user’s system, as well as the Python variant of theEmpireagent, EmPyre.[16]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors used a Python reverse shell and the PySoxy SOCKS5 proxy tool.[17][18]S0695DonutDonutcan generate shellcode outputs that execute via Python.[19]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas used various types of scripting to perform operations, including Python scripts.

Understanding standard usage patterns is important to avoid a high number of false positives. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent. Scripts are likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used.
