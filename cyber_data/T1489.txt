Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.[1][2]Adversaries may accomplish this by disabling individual services of high importance to an organization, such asMSExchangeIS, which will make Exchange content inaccessible[2]. In some cases, adversaries may stop or disable many or all services to render systems unusable.[1]Services or processes may not allow for modification of their data stores while running. Adversaries may stop services or processes in order to conductData DestructionorData Encrypted for Impacton the data stores of services like Exchange and SQL Server.[3]ID:T1489Sub-techniques:No
