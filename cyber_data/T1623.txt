These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, Android is a UNIX-like OS and includes a basicUnix Shellthat can be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or Java’sRuntimepackage.Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded inInitial Accesspayloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells.ID:T1623Sub-techniques:T1623.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.2Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:07 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1056TianySpyTianySpycan steal information via malicious JavaScript.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation can often detect jailbroken or rooted devices.M1010Deploy Compromised Device Detection MethodMobile security products can typically detect jailbroken or rooted devices.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could detect the invocations of methods that could be used to execute shell commands.[2]DS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand-line activities can potentially be detected through Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) integrations with lower-level OS APIs.
