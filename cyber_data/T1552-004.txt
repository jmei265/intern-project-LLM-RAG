Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures.[1]Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as~/.sshfor SSH keys on * nix-based systems orC:\Users\(username)\.ssh\on Windows. Adversary tools may also search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.[2][3]When a device is registered to Azure AD, a device key and a transport key are generated and used to verify the device’s identity.[4]An adversary with access to the device may be able to export the keys in order to impersonate the device.[5]On network devices, private keys may be exported viaNetwork Device CLIcommands such ascrypto pki export.[6]Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also useInput Capturefor keylogging or attempt toBrute Forcethe passphrase off-line. These private keys can be used to authenticate toRemote Serviceslike SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.ID:T1552.004Sub-technique of:T1552ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; Itzik Kotler, SafeBreachVersion:1.1Created:04 February 2020Last Modified:12 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan gather encryption keys from Azure AD services such as ADSync and Active Directory Federated Services servers.[7]S0377EburyEburyhas intercepted unencrypted private keys as well as private key pass-phrases.[8]S0363EmpireEmpirecan use modules likeInvoke-SessionGopherto extract private key and session information.[9]S0661FoggyWebFoggyWebcan retrieve token signing certificates and token decryption certificates from a compromised AD FS server.[10]S0601HildegardHildegardhas searched for private keys in .ssh.[11]S0283jRATjRATcan steal keys for VPNs and cryptocurrency wallets.[12]S0599KinsingKinsinghas searched for private keys.[13]S0409MacheteMachetehas scanned and looked for cryptographic keys and certificate file extensions.[14]S1060MafaldaMafaldacan collect a Chrome encryption key used to protect browser cookies.[15]S0002MimikatzMimikatz'sCRYPTO::Extractmodule can extract keys by interacting with Windows cryptographic application programming interface (API) functions.[16]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors usedMimikatzto dump certificates and private keys from the Windows certificate store.[17]G0106RockeRockehas used SSH private keys on the infected machine to spread its coinminer throughout a network.[18]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderenumerate and exfiltrate code-signing certificates from a compromised host.[19]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29obtained PKI keys, certificate files, and the private encryption key from an Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) container to decrypt corresponding SAML signing certificates.[20][21]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas searched for unsecured SSH keys.[22][23]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditEnsure only authorized keys are allowed access to critical resources and audit access lists regularly.M1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationWhen possible, store keys on separate cryptographic hardware instead of on the local system. For example, on Windows systems use a TPM to secure keys and other sensitive credential material.[4]M1027Password PoliciesUse strong passphrases for private keys to make cracking difficult.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsEnsure permissions are properly set on folders containing sensitive private keys to prevent unintended access. Additionally, on Cisco devices, set thenonexportableflag during RSA key pair generation.[6]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor access to files and directories related to cryptographic keys and certificates as a means for potentially detecting access patterns that may indicate collection and exfiltration activity.ReferencesWikipedia.
