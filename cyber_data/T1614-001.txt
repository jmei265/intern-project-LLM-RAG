This information may be used to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. This decision may be employed by malware developers and operators to reduce their risk of attracting the attention of specific law enforcement agencies or prosecution/scrutiny from other entities.[1]There are various sources of data an adversary could use to infer system language, such as system defaults and keyboard layouts. Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such asQuery Registryand calls toNative APIfunctions.[2]For example, on a Windows system adversaries may attempt to infer the language of a system by querying the registry keyHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Languageor parsing the outputs of Windows API functionsGetUserDefaultUILanguage,GetSystemDefaultUILanguage,GetKeyboardLayoutListandGetUserDefaultLangID.[3][4][5]On a macOS or Linux system, adversaries may querylocaleto retrieve the value of the$LANGenvironment variable.ID:T1614.001Sub-technique of:T1614ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:Harshal Tupsamudre, QualysVersion:1.0Created:18 August 2021Last Modified:15 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0640AvaddonAvaddonchecks for specific keyboard layouts and OS languages to avoid targeting Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) entities.[6]S0534BazarBazarcan perform a check to ensure that the operating system's keyboard and language settings are not set to Russian.[7]S0611ClopClophas checked the keyboard language using the GetKeyboardLayout() function to avoid installation on Russian-language or other Commonwealth of Independent States-language machines; it will also check theGetTextCharsetfunction.[8]S0625CubaCubacan check if Russian language is installed on the infected machine by using the functionGetKeyboardLayoutList.[9]S0616DEATHRANSOMSome versions ofDEATHRANSOMhave performed language ID and keyboard layout checks; if either of these matched Russian, Kazakh, Belarusian, Ukrainian or TatarDEATHRANSOMwould exit.[10]S0547DropBookDropBookhas checked for the presence of Arabic language in the infected machine's settings.[11]S0696FlagproFlagprocan check whether the target system is using Japanese, Taiwanese, or English through detection of specific Windows Security and Internet Explorer dialog.[12]S0632GrimAgentGrimAgenthas usedAccept-Languageto identify hosts in the United Kingdom, United States, France, and Spain.[13]G0004Ke3changKe3changhas used implants to collect the system language ID of a compromised machine.[14]G1026MalteiroMalteirowill terminateMispadu's infection process if the language of the victim machine is not Spanish or Portuguese.[15]S0652MarkiRATMarkiRATcan use theGetKeyboardLayoutAPI to check if a compromised host's keyboard is set to Persian.[16]S0449MazeMazehas checked the language of the machine with functionGetUserDefaultUILanguageand terminated execution if the language matches with an entry in the predefined list.[17]S0083MisdatMisdathas attempted to detect if a compromised host had a Japanese keyboard via the Windows API callGetKeyboardType.[18]S1122MispaduMispaduchecks and will terminate execution if the compromised system’s language ID is not Spanish or Portuguese.[19][15]S0691NeoichorNeoichorcan identify the system language on a compromised host.[14]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupdeployed malware designed not to run on computers set to Korean, Japanese, or Chinese in Windows language preferences.[20]S0496REvilREvilcan check the system language usingGetUserDefaultUILanguageandGetSystemDefaultUILanguage. If the language is found in the list, the process terminates.[21]S0446RyukRyukhas been observed to query the registry keyHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Nls\Languageand the valueInstallLanguage. If the machine has the value 0x419 (Russian), 0x422 (Ukrainian), or 0x423 (Belarusian), it stops execution.[2]S0085S-TypeS-Typehas attempted to determine if a compromised system was using a Japanese keyboard via theGetKeyboardTypeAPI call.[18]S0546SharpStageSharpStagehas been used to target Arabic-speaking users and used code that checks if the compromised machine has the Arabic language installed.[11]S0543SparkSparkhas checked the results of theGetKeyboardLayoutListand the language name returned byGetLocaleInfoAto make sure they contain the word "Arabic" before executing.[22]S0242SynAckSynAcklists all the keyboard layouts installed on the victim’s system usingGetKeyboardLayoutListAPI and checks against a hardcoded language code list. If a match if found, SynAck sleeps for 300 seconds and then exits without encrypting files.[5]S0658XCSSETXCSSETuses AppleScript to check the host's language and location with the commanduser locale of (get system info).[23]S0330Zeus PandaZeus Pandaqueries the system's keyboard mapping to determine the language used on the system. It will terminate execution if it detects LANG_RUSSIAN, LANG_BELARUSIAN, LANG_KAZAK, or LANG_UKRAINIAN.[24]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
