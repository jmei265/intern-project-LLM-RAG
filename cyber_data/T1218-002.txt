The Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) handles execution of Control Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings.Control Panel items are registered executable (.exe) or Control Panel (.cpl) files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library (.dll) files that export aCPlAppletfunction.[1][2]For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel.[1]Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface (API) call, or by simply double-clicking the file.[1][2][3]Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered viaPhishingcampaigns[2][3]or executed as part of multi-stage malware.[4]Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension allow lists.Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files (.dll) with Control Panel file extensions (.cpl) and register them toHKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls. Even when these registered DLLs do not comply with the CPL file specification and do not exportCPlAppletfunctions, they are loaded and executed through itsDllEntryPointwhen Control Panel is executed. CPL files not exportingCPlAppletare not directly executable.[5]ID:T1218.002Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEM, UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Application controlContributors:ESETVersion:2.0Created:23 January 2020Last Modified:11 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1003Ember BearEmber Bearhas used control panel files (CPL), delivered via e-mail, for execution.[6]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan register itself for execution and persistence via the Control Panel.[5]S0172ReaverReaverdrops and executes a malicious CPL file as its payload.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionIdentify and block potentially malicious and unknown .cpl files by using application control[7]tools, like Windows Defender Application Control[8], AppLocker,[9][10]or Software Restriction Policies[11]where appropriate.[12]M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsRestrict storage and execution of Control Panel items to protected directories, such asC:\Windows, rather than user directories.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionWhen executed from the command line or clicked, control.exe will execute the CPL file (ex:control.exe file.cpl) beforeRundll32is used to call the CPL's API functions (ex:rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL file.cpl).

These entries may contain information about the Control Panel item such as its display name, path to the local file, and the command executed when opened in the Control Panel.[1]* CPL format registered Control Panel items stored in the System32 directory are automatically shown in the Control Panel. Other Control Panel items will have registration entries in theCPLsandExtended PropertiesRegistry keys ofHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel. These entries may include information such as a GUID, path to the local file, and a canonical name used to launch the file programmatically (WinExec("c:\windows\system32\control.exe {Canonical_Name}", SW_NORMAL);) or from a command line (control.exe /name {Canonical_Name}).[1]* Some Control Panel items are extensible via Shell extensions registered inHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Controls Folder{name}\Shellex\PropertySheetHandlerswhere {name} is the predefined name of the system item.[1]ReferencesM.
