This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to protocol traffic, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols.ID:T1001Sub-techniques:T1001.001,T1001.002,T1001.003ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:02 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1111DarkGateDarkGatewill retrieved encrypted commands from its command and control server for follow-on actions such as cryptocurrency mining.[2]S0381FlawedAmmyyFlawedAmmyymay obfuscate portions of the initial C2 handshake.[3]S1120FRAMESTINGFRAMESTINGcan send and receive zlib compressed data withinPOSTrequests.[4]S1044FunnyDreamFunnyDreamcan send compressed and obfuscated packets to C2.[1]S1100NinjaNinjahas the ability to modify headers and URL paths to hide malicious traffic in HTTP requests.[5]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors encrypted IP addresses used for "Agent" proxy hops with RC4.[6]S0495RDATRDAThas used encoded data within subdomains as AES ciphertext to communicate from the host to the C2.[7]S0610SideTwistSideTwistcan embed C2 responses in the source code of a fake Flickr webpage.[8]S0533SLOTHFULMEDIASLOTHFULMEDIAhas hashed a string containing system information prior to exfiltration via POST requests.[9]S0682TrailBlazerTrailBlazercan masquerade its C2 traffic as legitimate Google Notifications HTTP requests.[10]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesVrabie, V.
