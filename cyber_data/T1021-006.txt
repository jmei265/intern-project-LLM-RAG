The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.WinRM is the name of both a Windows service and a protocol that allows a user to interact with a remote system (e.g., run an executable, modify the Registry, modify services).[1]It may be called with thewinrmcommand or by any number of programs such as PowerShell.[2]WinRM  can be used as a method of remotely interacting withWindows Management Instrumentation.[3]ID:T1021.006Sub-technique of:T1021ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:WindowsVersion:1.2Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:11 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1063Brute Ratel C4Brute Ratel C4can use WinRM for pivoting.[4]G0114ChimeraChimerahas used WinRM for lateral movement.[5]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan useWinRMto execute a payload on a remote host.[6][7]G1016FIN13FIN13has leveragedWMIto move laterally within a compromised network via application servers and SQL servers.[8]S0692SILENTTRINITYSILENTTRINITYtracksTrustedHostsand can move laterally to these targets via WinRM.[9]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used WinRM via PowerShell to execute commands and payloads on remote hosts.[10]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has used WinRM to enable remote execution.[11]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas used Window Remote Management to move laterally through a victim network.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramDisable the WinRM service.M1030Network SegmentationIf the service is necessary, lock down critical enclaves with separate WinRM infrastructure and follow WinRM best practices on use of host firewalls to restrict WinRM access to allow communication only to/from specific devices.[13]M1026Privileged Account ManagementIf the service is necessary, lock down critical enclaves with separate WinRM accounts and permissions.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may invoke a WinRM script to correlate it with other related events.[14]DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for user accounts logging into the system viaValid Accountsto interact with remote systems using Windows Remote Management (WinRM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections using Windows Remote Management (WinRM), such as remote WMI connection attempts (typically over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on RPC network flows.When a Windows Remote Management connection is opened, the client sends HTTP requests to port 5985 for HTTP or 5986 for HTTPS on the target host. Each HTTP(S) request to the URI "/wsman" is called, and other information is set in the headers. Depending on the operation, the HTTP method may vary (i.e., GET, POST, etc.). This analytic would detect Remote PowerShell, as well as other communications that rely on WinRM. Additionally, it outputs the executable on the client host, the connection information, and the hostname of the target host. Look for network connections to port 5985 and 5986. To really decipher what is going on, these outputs should be fed into something that can do packet analysis.Note: Traffic to the RPC Endpoint Mapper will always have the destination port of 135. Assuming success, RPC traffic will continue to the endpoint. The endpoint and the client both bind to dynamically assigned ports (on Windows, this is typically greater than 49152). The traffic between the client and endpoint can be detected by looking at traffic to 135 followed by traffic where the source and destination ports are at least 49152.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may useValid Accountsto interact with remote systems using Windows Remote Management (WinRM), as well as service processes such aswmiprvse.exeon destination hosts.DS0019ServiceService MetadataMonitor use of WinRM within an environment by tracking service execution. If it is not normally used or is disabled, then this may be an indicator of suspicious behavior.ReferencesMicrosoft. (n.d.). Windows Remote Management. Retrieved November 12, 2014.Jacobsen, K.
