Adversaries may use Wi-Fi information as part ofAccount Discovery,Remote System Discovery, and other discovery orCredential Accessactivity to support both ongoing and future campaigns.Adversaries may collect various types of information about Wi-Fi networks from hosts. For example, on Windows names and passwords of all Wi-Fi networks a device has previously connected to may be available throughnetsh wlan show profilesto enumerate Wi-Fi names and thennetsh wlan show profile "Wi-Fi name" key=clearto show a Wi-Fi network’s corresponding password.[1][2][3]Additionally, names and other details of locally reachable Wi-Fi networks can be discovered using calls towlanAPI.dllNative APIfunctions.[4]On Linux, names and passwords of all Wi-Fi-networks a device has previously connected to may be available in files under/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/.[5]On macOS, the password of a known Wi-Fi may be identified withsecurity find-generic-password -wa wifiname(requires admin username/password).[6]ID:T1016.002Sub-technique of:T1016ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Alex Spivakovsky, Pentera; Christopher Peacock; Liran Ravich, CardinalOps; Uriel KosayevVersion:1.0Created:08 September 2023Last Modified:05 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslacan collect names and passwords of all Wi-Fi networks to which a device has previously connected.[7]S0367EmotetEmotetcan extract names of all locally reachable Wi-Fi networks and then perform a brute-force attack to spread to new networks.[4]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas collected names and passwords of all Wi-Fi networks to which a device has previously connected.[3]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
