Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.[1][2][3][4]Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.Use of compromised infrastructure allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction withDigital Certificates) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/orPhishingcampaigns.[5]Additionally, adversaries may also compromise infrastructure to supportProxyand/or proxyware services.[6][7]By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them. Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.[8]ID:T1584Sub-techniques:T1584.001,T1584.002,T1584.003,T1584.004,T1584.005,T1584.006,T1584.007,T1584.008ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Jeremy Galloway; Shailesh Tiwary (Indian Army)Version:1.5Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:28 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0038Domain NameActive DNSMonitor for queried domain name system (DNS) registry data that may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.Domain RegistrationConsider monitoring for anomalous changes to domain registrant information and/or domain resolution information that may indicate the compromise of a domain. Efforts may need to be tailored to specific domains of interest as benign registration and resolution changes are a common occurrence on the internet.Passive DNSMonitor for logged domain name system (DNS) data that may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.DS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned compromised infrastructure (ex: a server for use in command and control), internet scans may help proactively discover compromised infrastructure. Consider looking for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software.[9][10][11]Response MetadataMonitor for contextual data about an Internet-facing resource gathered from a scan, such as running services or ports that may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.ReferencesMandiant. (n.d.). APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.
