This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. This algorithm can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.ID:T1637Sub-techniques:T1637.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:05 April 2022Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
