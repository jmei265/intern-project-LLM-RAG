Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.[2]Adversaries may compromise domain accounts, some with a high level of privileges, through various means such asOS Credential Dumpingor password reuse, allowing access to privileged resources of the domain.ID:T1078.002Sub-technique of:T1078ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserContributors:Jon Sternstein, Stern SecurityVersion:1.4Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3APT3leverages valid accounts after gaining credentials for use within the victim domain.[3]G1023APT5APT5has used legitimate account credentials to move laterally through compromised environments.[4]G0114ChimeraChimerahas used compromised domain accounts to gain access to the target environment.[5]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas obtained highly privileged credentials such as domain administrator in order to deploy malware.[6]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan use known credentials to run commands and spawn processes as a domain user account.[7][8][9]S1024CreepySnailCreepySnailcan use stolen credentials to authenticate on target networks.[10]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors used compromised VPN accounts for lateral movement on targeted networks.[11]G0119Indrik SpiderIndrik Spiderhas collected credentials from infected systems, including domain accounts.[12]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas used domain administrator accounts after dumping LSASS process memory.[13]G0019NaikonNaikonhas used administrator credentials for lateral movement in compromised networks.[14]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors used domain accounts to gain further access to victim systems.[15]C0012Operation CuckooBeesDuringOperation CuckooBees, the threat actors used compromised domain administrator credentials as part of their lateral movement.[16]C0023Operation GhostForOperation Ghost,APT29used stolen administrator credentials for lateral movement on compromised networks.[17]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors used domain credentials, including domain admin, for lateral movement and privilege escalation.[18]S0446RyukRyukcan use stolen domain admin accounts to move laterally within a victim domain.[19]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas used stolen credentials to access administrative accounts within the domain.[20][21]S0140ShamoonIfShamooncannot access shares using current privileges, it attempts access using hard coded, domain-specific credentials gathered earlier in the intrusion.[22][23]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used domain administrators' accounts to help facilitate lateral movement on compromised networks.[24]S0603StuxnetStuxnetattempts to access network resources with a domain account’s credentials.[25]G0092TA505TA505has used stolen domain admin accounts to compromise additional hosts.[26]G0028Threat Group-1314Threat Group-1314actors used compromised domain credentials for the victim's endpoint management platform, Altiris, to move laterally.[27]G1022ToddyCatToddyCathas used compromised domain admin credentials to mount local network shares.[28]G1017Volt TyphoonVolt Typhoonhas used compromised domain accounts to authenticate to devices on compromised networks.[29][30]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas used administrative accounts, including Domain Admin, to move laterally within a victim network.[31]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs.M1026Privileged Account ManagementAudit domain account permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account. Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled and use of accounts is segmented, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent access if account credentials are obtained.M1017User TrainingApplications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.A remote desktop logon, throughRemote Desktop Protocol, may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.Multiple users logged into a single machine at the same time, or even within the same hour, do not typically occur in networks we have observed.Logon events are Windows Event Code 4624 for Windows Vista and above, 518 for pre-Vista. Logoff events are 4634 for Windows Vista and above, 538 for pre-Vista. Logon types 2, 3, 9 and 10 are of interest. For more details see the Logon Types table on Microsoft’s Audit Logon Events page.Analytic 1 - Remote Desktop Logon(source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4624") AuthenticationPackageName= "Negotiate" AND Severity= "Information" AND logon_type= "10"Logon Session MetadataCorrelate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by the use of domain authentication services, such as the System Security Services Daemon (sssd) on LinuxNote:For Windows, Security Logs events, including Event ID 4624, can be monitored to track user login behavior.For Linux, auditing frameworks that support File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), including the audit daemon (auditd), can be used to alert on changes to files that store login information. These files include:/etc/login.defs,/etc/securetty,/var/log/faillog,/var/log/lastlog,/var/log/tallylog.For MacOS, auditing frameworks that support capturing information on user logins, such as OSQuery, can be used to audit user account logins and authentications.ReferencesMicrosoft.
