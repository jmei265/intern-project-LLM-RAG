Images may also be captured, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.Malware or scripts may interact with the device cameras through an available API provided by the operating system. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs fromScreen Capturedue to use of the device’s cameras for video recording rather than capturing the victim’s screen.In Android, an application must hold theandroid.permission.CAMERApermission to access the cameras. In iOS, applications must include theNSCameraUsageDescriptionkey in theInfo.plistfile. In both cases, the user must grant permission to the requesting application to use the camera. If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, an adversary may be able to access the camera without knowledge of the user.ID:T1512Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-19Version:2.1Created:09 August 2019Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmucan grant itself camera permissions.[1]S0292AndroRATAndroRATcan take photos and videos using the device cameras.[2]S1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYcan take photos using the device cameras.[3]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan record from the device’s camera.[4]S0426Concipit1248Concipit1248requests permissions to use the device camera.[5]S0425Corona UpdatesCorona Updatescan take pictures using the camera and can record MP4 files.[5]S0301DendroidDendroidcan take photos and record videos.[6]S0505Desert ScorpionDesert Scorpioncan record videos.[7]S0320DroidJackDroidJackcan capture video using device cameras.[8]S1092EscobarEscobarcan take photos using the device cameras.[9]S0405ExodusExodusTwo can take pictures with the device cameras.[10]S1080FakecallsFakecallscan request camera permissions.[11]S0408FlexiSpyFlexiSpycan record video.[12]S0535Golden CupGolden Cupcan take pictures with the camera.[13]S0551GoldenEagleGoldenEaglehas taken photos with the device camera.[14]S0421GolfSpyGolfSpycan record video.[15]S0544HenBoxHenBoxcan access the device’s camera.[16]S1128HilalRATHilalRATcan activate a device’s camera.[17]S1077HornbillHornbillcan access a device’s camera and take photos.[18]S0407MonokleMonoklecan take photos and videos.[19]S0399PallasPallascan take pictures with both the front and rear-facing cameras.[20]S0316Pegasus for AndroidPegasus for Androidhas the ability to take pictures using the device camera.[21]S1126PhenakitePhenakitecan capture pictures and videos.[22]S0295RCSAndroidRCSAndroidcan capture photos using the front and back cameras.[23]S0549SilkBeanSilkBeancan access the camera on the device.[14]S0327SkygofreeSkygofreecan record video or capture photos when an infected device is in a specified location.[24]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealercan record video and take photos via front and rear cameras.[25]S0328Stealth MangoStealth Mangocan record and take pictures using the front and back cameras.[26]S1082SunbirdSunbirdcan access a device’s camera and take photos.[18]S1069TangleBotTangleBotcan record video from the device camera.[27]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Procan capture photos and videos from the device’s camera.[28]S0418ViceLeakerViceLeakercan take photos from both the front and back cameras.[29]S0506ViperRATViperRATcan take photos with the device camera.[30]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas included video recording in the malicious apps deployed as part of Operation BULL.[31]S0489WolfRATWolfRATcan take photos and videos.[32]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionAndroid 9 and above restricts access to the mic, camera, and other device sensors from applications running in the background. iOS 14 and Android 12 introduced a visual indicator on the status bar (green dot) when an application is accessing the device’s camera.[33]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingPermissions RequestsDuring the vetting process, applications using the Android permissionandroid.permission.CAMERA, or the iOSNSCameraUsageDescriptionplist entry could be given closer scrutiny.DS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsThe user can view which applications have permission to use the camera through the device settings screen, where the user can then choose to revoke the permissions.ReferencesP Shunk, K Balaam.
