Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.[1]Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying. Commonly targeted services include the following:SSH (22/TCP)Telnet (23/TCP)FTP (21/TCP)NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)LDAP (389/TCP)Kerberos (88/TCP)RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)MSSQL (1433/TCP)Oracle (1521/TCP)MySQL (3306/TCP)VNC (5900/TCP)In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.[2]In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.ID:T1110.003Sub-technique of:T1110ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:John Strand; Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)Version:1.5Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:07 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in password-spraying mode it conducted approximately four authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of several days or weeks.[3][4]APT28has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-scale password spray attacks.[5]G0016APT29APT29has conducted brute force password spray attacks.[6][7][8]G0064APT33APT33has used password spraying to gain access to target systems.[9][10]S0606Bad RabbitBad Rabbit’sinfpub.datfile uses NTLM login credentials to brute force Windows machines.[11]G0114ChimeraChimerahas used multiple password spraying attacks against victim's remote services to obtain valid user and administrator accounts.[12]S0488CrackMapExecCrackMapExeccan brute force credential authentication by using a supplied list of usernames and a single password.[13]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used password spraying attacks to obtain valid credentials.[14]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Groupmalware attempts to connect to Windows shares for lateral movement by using a generated list of usernames, which center around permutations of the username Administrator, and weak passwords.[15][16]G0077LeafminerLeafminerused a tool called Total SMB BruteForcer to perform internal password spraying.[17]S0362Linux RabbitLinux Rabbitbrute forces SSH passwords in order to attempt to gain access and install its malware onto the server.[18]S0413MailSniperMailSnipercan be used for password spraying against Exchange and Office 365.[19]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas used collected lists of names and e-mail accounts to use in password spraying attacks against private sector targets.[20]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1036Account Use PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.[21]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[22]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures ofValid Accounts.
