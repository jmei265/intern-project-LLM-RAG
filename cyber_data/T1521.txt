Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if necessary secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.ID:T1521Sub-techniques:T1521.001,T1521.002,T1521.003Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:2.0Created:01 October 2019Last Modified:05 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1095AhRatAhRatcan communicate with the C2 using HTTPS requests.[1]S0302TwitoorTwitoorencrypts its C2 communication.[2]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
