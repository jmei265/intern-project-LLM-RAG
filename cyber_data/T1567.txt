Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.ID:T1567Sub-techniques:T1567.001,T1567.002,T1567.003,T1567.004ⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Google Workspace, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:William CainVersion:1.3Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:05 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0622AppleSeedAppleSeedhas exfiltrated files using web services.[1]G0007APT28APT28can exfiltrate data over Google Drive.[2]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41used Cloudflare services for data exfiltration.[3]S0547DropBookDropBookhas used legitimate web services to exfiltrate data.[4]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas used the Telegram APIsendMessageto relay data on compromised devices.[5]S0508ngrokngrokhas been used by threat actors to configure servers for data exfiltration.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1057Data Loss PreventionData loss prevention can be detect and block sensitive data being uploaded to web services via web browsers.M1021Restrict Web-Based ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentReview logs for SaaS services, including Office 365 and Google Workspace, to detect the configuration of new webhooks or other features that could be abused to exfiltrate data.DS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for files being accessed by an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections to web and cloud services associated with abnormal or non-browser processes.Network Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesKISA. (n.d.).
