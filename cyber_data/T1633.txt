This may include changing behaviors after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware’s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the payload. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping further payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned fromVirtualization/Sandbox Evasionduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.Adversaries may use several methods to accomplishVirtualization/Sandbox Evasionsuch as checking for system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment.ID:T1633Sub-techniques:T1633.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmuhas used code abstraction and anti-emulation checks to potentially avoid running while under analysis.[1]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
