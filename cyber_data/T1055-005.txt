TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.TLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to setup and/or cleanup data used by threads. Manipulating TLS callbacks may be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’ memory space using otherProcess Injectiontechniques such asProcess Hollowing.[1]Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.ID:T1055.005Sub-technique of:T1055ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application controlVersion:1.1Created:14 January 2020Last Modified:18 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0386UrsnifUrsnifhas injected code into target processes via thread local storage callbacks.[2][3][4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThread,SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.[5]Process AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage (TLS) callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.Process ModificationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage (TLS) callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.ReferencesVaish, A. & Nemes, S.
