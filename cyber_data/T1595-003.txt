While this technique employs similar methods toBrute Force, its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques (ex:Gather Victim Org Information, orSearch Victim-Owned Websites).For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website’s pages and directories.[1]This can help them to discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that could become the target of further operations (ex:Exploit Public-Facing ApplicationorBrute Force).As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.[2][3]Once storage objects are discovered, adversaries may leverageData from Cloud Storageto access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate privileges and move laterally.ID:T1595.003Sub-technique of:T1595ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Elvis Veliz, Citi; Jan Petrov, Citi; Richard Julian, CitiVersion:1.0Created:04 March 2022Last Modified:15 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41APT41leverages various tools and frameworks to brute-force directories on web servers.[4]G0123Volatile CedarVolatile Cedarhas used DirBuster and GoBuster to brute force web directories and DNS subdomains.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramRemove or disable access to any systems, resources, and infrastructure that are not explicitly required to be available externally.M1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
