Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems. This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems. In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control.ID:T1001.002Sub-technique of:T1001ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:15 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0001AxiomAxiomhas used steganography to hide its C2 communications.[1]S0187DaserfDaserfcan use steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim.[2]S0038DuquWhen theDuqucommand and control is operating over HTTP or HTTPS, Duqu uploads data to its controller by appending it to a blank JPG file.[3]S0037HAMMERTOSSHAMMERTOSSis controlled via commands that are appended to image files.[4]S0395LightNeuronLightNeuronis controlled via commands that are embedded into PDFs and JPGs using steganographic methods.[5]C0023Operation GhostDuringOperation Ghost,APT29used steganography to hide the communications between the implants and their C&C servers.[6]S0495RDATRDATcan process steganographic images attached to email messages to send and receive C2 commands.RDATcan also embed additional messages within BMP images to communicate with theRDAToperator.[7]S0633SliverSlivercan encode binary data into a .PNG file for C2 communication.[8]S0559SUNBURSTSUNBURSTC2 data attempted to appear as benign XML related to .NET assemblies or as a faux JSON blob.[9][10][11]S0230ZeroTZeroThas retrieved stage 2 payloads as Bitmap images that use Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.[12][13]S0672ZoxZoxhas used the .PNG file format for C2 communications.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).ReferencesNovetta.
