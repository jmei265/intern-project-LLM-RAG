Adversaries may use the information fromSystem Information Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Tools such asSysteminfocan be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through thesystemsetupconfiguration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute thedf -aHcommand to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage aNetwork Device CLIon network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g.show version).[1]System Information Discoverycombined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.[2][3]Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.[4][5][6]ID:T1082Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; Maril Vernon @shewhohacks; PraetorianVersion:2.5Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS00654H RAT4H RATsends an OS version identifier in its beacons.[7]S1028Action RATAction RAThas the ability to collect the hostname, OS version, and OS architecture of an infected host.[8]G0018admin@338admin@338actors used the following commands after exploiting a machine withLOWBALLmalware to obtain information about the OS:ver >> %temp%\downloadsysteminfo >> %temp%\download[9]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLcan runSysteminfoto gather information about the victim.[10][11]S0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslacan collect the system's computer name and also has the capability to collect information on the processor, memory, OS, and video card from the system.[12][13][14]S1129AkiraAkirauses theGetSystemInfoWindows function to determine the number of processors on a victim machine.[15]S1025AmadeyAmadeyhas collected the computer name and OS version from a compromised machine.[16][17]S0504AnchorAnchorcan determine the hostname and linux version on a compromised host.[18]S0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas collected the victim host information after infection.[19]S0622AppleSeedAppleSeedcan identify the OS version of a targeted system.[20]G0026APT18APT18can collect system information from the victim’s machine.[21]G0073APT19APT19collected system architecture information.APT19used an HTTP malware variant and a Port 22 malware variant to gather the hostname and CPU information from the victim’s machine.[22][23]G0022APT3APT3has a tool that can obtain information about the local system.[24][25]G0050APT32APT32has collected the OS version and computer name from victims.
