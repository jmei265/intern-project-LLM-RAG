For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using theLogonUserfunction.[1]The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can useSetThreadTokento assign the token to a thread.This behavior is distinct fromToken Impersonation/Theftin that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one.ID:T1134.003Sub-technique of:T1134ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserⓘEffective Permissions:SYSTEMⓘDefense Bypassed:File system access controls, System access controls, Windows User Account ControlContributors:Jonny JohnsonVersion:1.1Created:18 February 2020Last Modified:10 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan make tokens from known credentials.[2]G1016FIN13FIN13has utilized tools such as Incognito V2 for token manipulation and impersonation.[3]S1060MafaldaMafaldacan create a token for a different user.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit permissions so that users and user groups cannot create tokens. This setting should be defined for the local system account only. GPO: Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Create a token object.[5]Also define who can create a process level token to only the local and network service through GPO: Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment: Replace a process level token.[6]Administrators should log in as a standard user but run their tools with administrator privileges using the built-in access token manipulation commandrunas.[7]M1018User Account ManagementAn adversary must already have administrator level access on the local system to make full use of this technique; be sure to restrict users and accounts to the least privileges they require.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments to detect token manipulation by auditing command-line activity. Specifically, analysts should look for use of the runas command or similar artifacts. Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.[8]DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with detecting token manipulation only through careful analysis of user activity, examination of running processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior, such as LogonUser and SetThreadToken. Correlate activity with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives that may be due to normal benign use by users and administratorsReferencesMicrosoft. (2023, March 10).
