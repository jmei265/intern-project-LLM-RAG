Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.Duquwas an early example of malware that used steganography. It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.[1]By the end of 2017, a threat group usedInvoke-PSImageto hidePowerShellcommands in an image file (.png) and execute the code on a victim's system. In this particular case thePowerShellcode downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.[2]ID:T1027.003Sub-technique of:T1027ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.2Created:05 February 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0469ABKABKcan extract a malicious Portable Executable (PE) from a photo.[3]G0138AndarielAndarielhas hidden malicious executables within PNG files.[4][5]G0067APT37APT37uses steganography to send images to users that are embedded with shellcode.[6][7]S0473AvengerAvengercan extract backdoor malware from downloaded images.[3]S0234BandookBandookhas used .PNG images within a zip file to build the executable.[8]S0470BBKBBKcan extract a malicious Portable Executable (PE) from a photo.[3]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas used steganography in multiple operations to conceal malicious payloads.[3]S0471build_downerbuild_downercan extract malware from a downloaded JPEG.[3]S0659DiavolDiavolhas obfuscated its main code routines within bitmap images as part of its anti-analysis techniques.[9]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas used steganography to hide shellcode in a BMP image file.[10]S0483IcedIDIcedIDhas embedded binaries within RC4 encrypted .png files.[11]S0231Invoke-PSImageInvoke-PSImagecan be used to embed a PowerShell script within the pixels of a PNG file.[12]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas used steganography to hide stolen data inside other files stored on Github.[13]S0513LiteDukeLiteDukehas used image files to hide its loader component.[14]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas stored obfuscated JavaScript code in an image file named temp.jpg.[15]S0644ObliqueRATObliqueRATcan hide its payload in BMP images hosted on compromised websites.[16]S0439OkrumOkrum's payload is encrypted and embedded within its loader, or within a legitimate PNG file.[17]C0023Operation GhostDuringOperation Ghost,APT29used steganography to hide payloads inside valid images.[14]C0005Operation SpalaxForOperation Spalax, the threat actors used packers that read pixel data from images contained in PE files' resource sections and build the next layer of execution from the data.[18]S0518PolyglotDukePolyglotDukecan use steganography to hide C2 information in images.[14]S0139PowerDukePowerDukeuses steganography to hide backdoors in PNG files, which are also encrypted using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA).[19]S0654ProLockProLockcan use .jpg and .bmp files to store its payload.[20]S0565RaindropRaindropused steganography to locate the start of its encoded payload within legitimate 7-Zip code.[21]S0458RamsayRamsayhas PE data embedded within JPEG files contained within Word documents.[22]S0495RDATRDATcan also embed data within a BMP image prior to exfiltration.[23]S0511RegDukeRegDukecan hide data in images, including use of the Least Significant Bit (LSB).[14]G0127TA551TA551has hidden encoded data for malware DLLs in a PNG.[24]G0081Tropic TrooperTropic Trooperhas used JPG files with encrypted payloads to mask their backdoor routines and evade detection.[25]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
