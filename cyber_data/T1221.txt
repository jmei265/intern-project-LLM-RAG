For example, Microsoft’s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.[1]Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs. For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents. Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.[2]These documents can be delivered via other techniques such asPhishingand/orTaint Shared Contentand may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.[3]Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.[4]Adversaries may also modify the*\templatecontrol word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code. This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened. However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.[5][6]This technique may also enableForced Authenticationby injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.[7][8][9]ID:T1221Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Static File AnalysisContributors:Brian Wiltse @evalstrings; Michael Raggi @aRtAGGI; Patrick Campbell, @pjcampbe11Version:1.3Created:17 October 2018Last Modified:12 January 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28used weaponized Microsoft Word documents abusing the remote template function to retrieve a malicious macro.[10]S0631ChaesChaeschanged the template target of the settings.xml file embedded in the Word document and populated that field with the downloaded URL of the next payload.[11]G0142ConfuciusConfuciushas used a weaponized Microsoft Word document with an embedded RTF exploit.[12]G0079DarkHydrusDarkHydrusused an open-source tool, Phishery, to inject malicious remote template URLs into Microsoft Word documents and then sent them to victims to enableForced Authentication.[13]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiateForced Authentication.[14]C0001FrankensteinDuringFrankenstein, the threat actors used trojanized documents that retrieved remote templates from an adversary-controlled website.[15]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas used DOCX files to download malicious DOT document templates and has used RTF template injection to download malicious payloads.[5]Gamaredon Groupcan also inject malicious macros or remote templates into documents already present on compromised systems.[16][17][18][19][20][21]G0100InceptionInceptionhas used decoy documents to load malicious remote payloads via HTTP.[22]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused DOCX files to retrieve a malicious document template/DOTM file.[23][24]G0081Tropic TrooperTropic Trooperdelivered malicious documents with the XLSX extension, typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself was actually an OLE (XLS) document.[25]S0670WarzoneRATWarzoneRAThas been install via template injection through a malicious DLL embedded within a template RTF in a Word document.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1049Antivirus/AntimalwareNetwork/Host intrusion prevention systems, antivirus, and detonation chambers can be employed to prevent documents from fetching and/or executing malicious payloads.[7]M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider disabling Microsoft Office macros/active content to prevent the execution of malicious payloads in documents[26], though this setting may not mitigate theForced Authenticationuse for this technique.M1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork/Host intrusion prevention systems, antivirus, and detonation chambers can be employed to prevent documents from fetching and/or executing malicious payloads.[7]M1017User TrainingTrain users to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails that could be used to deliver malicious documents.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.Network Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
