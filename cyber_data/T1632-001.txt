Code signing provides a level of authenticity on an app from a developer, guaranteeing that the program has not been tampered with and comes from an official source. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on a device.Mobile devices generally enable these security controls by default, such as preventing the installation of unknown applications on Android. Adversaries may modify these policies in a number of ways, includingInput Injectionor malicious configuration profiles.ID:T1632.001Sub-technique of:T1632Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:STA-7Version:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:16 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0505Desert ScorpionIf running on a Huawei device,Desert Scorpionadds itself to the protected apps list, which allows it to run with the screen off.[1]S0420DvmapDvmapcan enable installation of apps from unknown sources.[2]S0551GoldenEagleGoldenEaglehas modified or configured proxy information.[3]S0485MandrakeMandrakecan enable app installation from unknown sources.[4]S0549SilkBeanSilkBeanhas attempted to trick users into enabling installation of applications from unknown sources.[3]S1056TianySpyTianySpycan install malicious configurations on iPhones to allow malware to be installed via Ad Hoc distribution.[5]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas installed malicious MDM profiles on iOS devices as part of Operation ROCK.[6]S0490XLoader for iOSXLoader for iOShas been installed via a malicious configuration profile.[7]S0311YiSpecterYiSpecterhas used fake Verisign and Symantec certificates to bypass malware detection systems.YiSpecterhas also signed malicious apps with iOS enterprise certificates to work on non-jailbroken iOS devices.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1012Enterprise PolicyOn iOS, theallowEnterpriseAppTrustandallowEnterpriseAppTrustModificationconfiguration profile restrictions can be used to prevent users from installing apps signed using enterprise distribution keys.M1006Use Recent OS VersionMobile OSes have implemented measures to make it more difficult to trick users into installing untrusted certificates and configurations. iOS 10.3 and higher add an additional step for users to install new trusted CA certificates and configuration profiles. On Android, apps that target compatibility with Android 7 and higher (API Level 24) default to only trusting CA certificates that are bundled with the operating system, not CA certificates that are added by the user or administrator, hence decreasing their susceptibility to successful adversary-in-the-middle attack.[9][10]M1011User GuidanceTypically, insecure or malicious configuration settings are not installed without the user's consent. Users should be advised not to install unexpected configuration settings (CA certificates, iOS Configuration Profiles, Mobile Device Management server provisioning).DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsOn Android, the user can use the device settings menu to view trusted CA certificates and look for unexpected or unknown certificates. A mobile security product could similarly examine the trusted CA certificate store for anomalies. Users can use the device settings menu to view which applications on the device are allowed to install unknown applications.On iOS, the user can use the device settings menu to view installed Configuration Profiles and look for unexpected or unknown profiles. A Mobile Device Management (MDM) system could use the iOS MDM APIs to examine the list of installed Configuration Profiles for anomalies.ReferencesA. Blaich, M. Flossman. (2018, April 16).
