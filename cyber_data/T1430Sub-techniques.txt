On Android 10 and up, declaration of theACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATIONpermission in an application’s manifest will allow applications to request location access even when the application is running in the background.[1]Some adversaries have utilized integration of Baidu map services to retrieve geographical location once the location access permissions had been obtained.[2][3]On iOS, applications must include theNSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription,NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription, and/orNSLocationAlwaysUsageDescriptionkeys in theirInfo.plistfile depending on the extent of requested access to location information.[4]On iOS 8.0 and up, applications callrequestWhenInUseAuthorization()to request access to location information when the application is in use orrequestAlwaysAuthorization()to request access to location information regardless of whether the application is in use. With elevated privileges, an adversary may be able to access location data without explicit user consent with thecom.apple.locationd.preauthorizedentitlement key.[5]ID:T1430Sub-techniques:T1430.001,T1430.002Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Collection,DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-24Version:1.2Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmucan access a device's location.[6]S0309AdupsAdupstransmitted location information.[7]S1095AhRatAhRatcan track the device’s location.[8]S0304Android/Chuli.AAndroid/Chuli.Astole geo-location data.[9]S0292AndroRATAndroRATtracks the device location.[10]S0422AnubisAnubiscan retrieve the device’s GPS location.[11]S1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYcan get a device’s location using GPS or network.[12]S1094BRATABRATAcan track the device's location.[13]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan collect the device’s location information based on cellular network or GPS coordinates.[14]C0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto access the device’s location.[15]S0529CarbonStealCarbonStealcan access the device’s location and track the device over time.[16]S0480CerberusCerberuscan collect the device’s location.[17]S1083ChameleonChameleoncan gather device location data.[18]S0323ChargerChargerchecks the local settings of the device and does not run its malicious logic if the device is located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus.[19]S0555CHEMISTGAMESCHEMISTGAMEShas collected the device’s location.[20]S0425Corona UpdatesCorona Updatescan track the device’s location.[21]S0505Desert ScorpionDesert Scorpioncan track the device’s location.[22]S1092EscobarEscobarcan request coarse and fine location permissions to track the device.[23]S0507eSurveSurvcan track the device’s location.[24]S0405ExodusExodusTwo can extract the GPS coordinates of the device.[25]S1080FakecallsFakecallscan access a device’s location.[26]S0182FinFisherFinFishertracks the latitude and longitude coordinates of the infected device.[27]S0408FlexiSpyFlexiSpycan track the device's location.[28]S1093FlyTrapFlyTrapcan collect device geolocation data.[29]S0577FrozenCellFrozenCellhas used an online cell tower geolocation service to track targets.[30]S0535Golden CupGolden Cupcan track the device’s location.[31]S0551GoldenEagleGoldenEaglehas tracked location.[16]S0421GolfSpyGolfSpycan track the device’s location.[32]S0536GPlayedGPlayedcan request the device’s location.[33]S0544HenBoxHenBoxcan track the device’s location.[3]S1128HilalRATHilalRATcan access a device’s location.[34]S1077HornbillHornbillcan access a device’s location and check if GPS is enabled.Hornbillhas logic to only log location changes greater than 70 meters.[35]S0463INSOMNIAINSOMNIAcan track the device’s location.[5]S0485MandrakeMandrakecan collect the device’s location.[36]S0407MonokleMonoklecan track the device's location.[37]S0399PallasPallastracks the latitude and longitude coordinates of the infected device.[27]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOSupdate and sends the location of the phone.[38]S0291PJAppsPJAppshas the capability to collect and leak the victim's location.[10]S0295RCSAndroidRCSAndroidcan record location.[39]S0549SilkBeanSilkBeanhas access to the device’s location.[16]S0327SkygofreeSkygofreecan track the device's location.[40]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealerharvests location data from victims.[2]S0305SpyNote RATSpyNote RATcollects the device's location.[41]S0328Stealth MangoStealth Mangocan perform GPS location tracking as well as capturing coordinates as when an SMS message or call is received.[42]S1082SunbirdSunbirdcan access a device’s location.[35]S0329TangeloTangelocontains functionality to gather GPS coordinates.[42]S1069TangleBotTangleBotcan request location permissions.[43]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Procan track the device’s location.[44]S0418ViceLeakerViceLeakercan collect location information, including GPS coordinates.[45][46]S0506ViperRATViperRATcan track the device’s location.[47]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas included location tracking capabilities in the malicious apps deployed as part of Operation BULL and Operation ROCK.[48]S0314X-Agent for AndroidX-Agent for Androidwas believed to have been used to obtain locational data of Ukrainian artillery forces.[49]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1012Enterprise PolicyIf devices are enrolled using Apple User Enrollment or using a profile owner enrollment mode for Android, device controls prevent the enterprise from accessing the device’s physical location.
