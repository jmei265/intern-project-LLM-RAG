This attack uses /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz, which comprises all unique passwords from the 32 million RockYou password breach.

    Open a terminal and elevate to a root shell (or, alternatively, run all commands below with sudo):

    sudo -s

First, if the file /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt is not present, unzip the password list.

gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

We will use the ‘rockyou’ password list to launch an online password attack using THC-Hydra. The attack will be launched against a website that is managed by Dr. Eargle, who authorizes you to launch the attack only as specified in the instructions below.

Visit https://is.theorizeit.org in a browser, and note that it is an installation of mediawiki. Now browse to subdirectory https://is.theorizeit.org/auth/. It requires a login. Let’s say that you wanted to crack the password for this route. Imagine that you knew, or guessed, that one of the usernames was istheory.

Type the following, all on one line (remember that you can use tab-completion for the rockyou path). Run the command after you read the explanatory text below the command on this page.

hydra -V -l istheory -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt https-get://is.theorizeit.org/auth/

Note: The trailing slash (/) in the final argument is needed.

Where:

    hydra is the password cracking tool to execute.
    -V means verbose, and will show you the username and password combination being attempted.
    -l istheory sets “istheory” as the login name. Note: that’s a lowercase ‘L.’
    -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt is the password dictionary file to use.
        the password is case-sensitive!
    https-get means a GET request over HTTPS. Note that Hydra supports many protocols (e.g., ftp, ssh).
    is.theorizeit.org/auth/ is the password-protected URL to be accessed.

Tip This is a good opportunity to look at a command's built-in help documentation. Run hydra -h and peruse the output to find each of the above arguments, and read what they do. What would a lowercase -p have signified, instead of the uppercase -P used? What would an uppercase -L have signified? Argument casing matters for this program!

In Greek and Roman mythology, Hydra is a mythical sea monster with many heads. When a head is cut off, it is replaced by another. THC Hydra, the tool you are using, likewise launches multiple “heads” (tasks), each of which makes a battery of attacks (password guesses) before dying off and being replaced by another head (task). By default, Hydra runs with 16 concurrent heads.

The Hydra output will tell you at what time it started, how many passwords it has tried so far, and at what time it stopped.
