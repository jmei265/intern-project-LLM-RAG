This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such asSharepointor webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.[4]ID:T1185Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEMContributors:Justin Warner, ICEBRGVersion:2.0Created:16 January 2018Last Modified:25 February 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas the ability to use form-grabbing to extract data from web data forms.[5]S0484CarberpCarberphas captured credentials when a user performs login through a SSL session.[6][7]S0631ChaesChaeshas used the Puppeteer module to hook and monitor the Chrome web browser to collect user information from infected hosts.[8]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan perform browser pivoting and inject into a user's browser to inherit cookies, authenticated HTTP sessions, and client SSL certificates.[4][9]S0384DridexDridexcan perform browser attacks via web injects to steal information such as credentials, certificates, and cookies.[10]S0531GrandoreiroGrandoreirocan monitor browser activity for online banking actions and display full-screen overlay images to block user access to the intended site or present additional data fields.[11][12][13]S0483IcedIDIcedIDhas used web injection attacks to redirect victims to spoofed sites designed to harvest banking and other credentials.IcedIDcan use a self signed TLS certificate in connection with the spoofed site and simultaneously maintains a live connection with the legitimate site to display the correct URL and certificates in the browser.[14][15]S0530MelcozMelcozcan monitor the victim's browser for online banking sessions and display an overlay window to manipulate the session in the background.[11]S0650QakBotQakBotcan use advanced web injects to steal web banking credentials.[16][17]S0266TrickBotTrickBotuses web injects and browser redirection to trick the user into providing their login credentials on a fake or modified web page.[18][19][20][21]S0386UrsnifUrsnifhas injected HTML codes into banking sites to steal sensitive online banking information (ex: usernames and passwords).[22]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementSince browser pivoting requires a high integrity process to launch from, restricting user permissions and addressing Privilege Escalation andBypass User Account Controlopportunities can limit the exposure to this technique.M1017User TrainingClose all browser sessions regularly and when they are no longer needed.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationAuthentication logs can be used to audit logins to specific web applications, but determining malicious logins versus benign logins may be difficult if activity matches typical user behavior.DS0009ProcessProcess AccessThis may be a difficult technique to detect because adversary traffic may be masked by normal user traffic.
