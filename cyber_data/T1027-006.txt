HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.[1][2]Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes. Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such astext/plainand/ortext/html. Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim (i.e.Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information), potentially bypassing content filters.For example, JavaScript Blobs can be abused to dynamically generate malicious files in the victim machine and may be dropped to disk by abusing JavaScript functions such asmsSaveBlob.[1][3][2][4]ID:T1027.006Sub-technique of:T1027ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Static File Analysis, Web Content FiltersContributors:Jonathan Boucher, @crash_wave, Bank of Canada; Krishnan Subramanian, @krish203; Stan Hegt, Outflank; Vinay PidathalaVersion:1.1Created:20 May 2021Last Modified:14 July 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has embedded an ISO file within an HTML attachment that contained JavaScript code to initiate malware execution.[5]S0634EnvyScoutEnvyScoutcontains JavaScript code that can extract an encoded blob from its HTML body and write it to disk.[6]S0650QakBotQakBothas been delivered in ZIP files via HTML smuggling.[7][8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1048Application Isolation and SandboxingBrowser sandboxes can be used to mitigate some of the impact of exploitation, but sandbox escapes may still exist.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files via JavaScript, developing rules for the different variants, with a combination of different encoding and/or encryption schemes, may be very challenging. Consider monitoring files downloaded from the Internet, possibly by HTML Smuggling, for suspicious activities. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities.ReferencesSubramanian, K. (2020, August 18).
