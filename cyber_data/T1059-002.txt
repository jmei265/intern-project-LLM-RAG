AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.[1]These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.Scripts can be run from the command-line viaosascript /path/to/scriptorosascript -e "script here". Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows. AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding#!/usr/bin/osascriptto the start of the script file.[2]AppleScripts do not need to callosascriptto execute. However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOSNative APIsNSAppleScriptorOSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the/usr/bin/osascriptcommand line utility.Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely. On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to executeNative APIs, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.[3]Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell viaPython.[4]ID:T1059.002Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:macOSContributors:Phil Stokes, SentinelOneVersion:1.2Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0482BundloreBundlorecan use AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser.[5]S0281DokDokuses AppleScript to create a login item for persistence.[6]S1048macOS.OSAMinermacOS.OSAMinerhas usedosascriptto call itself via thedo shell scriptcommand in theLaunch Agent.plistfile.[7]S0595ThiefQuestThiefQuestusesAppleScript'sosascript -ecommand to launchThiefQuest's persistence viaLaunch AgentandLaunch Daemon.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1045Code SigningRequire that all AppleScript be signed by a trusted developer ID before being executed - this will prevent random AppleScript code from executing.[9]This subjects AppleScript code to the same scrutiny as other .app files passing through Gatekeeper.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control where appropriate.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse AppleScript for execution.
