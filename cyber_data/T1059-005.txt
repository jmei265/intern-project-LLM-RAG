VB is a programming language created by Microsoft with interoperability with many Windows technologies such asComponent Object Modeland theNative APIthrough the Windows API. Although tagged as legacy with no planned future evolutions, VB is integrated and supported in the .NET Framework and cross-platform .NET Core.[1][2]Derivative languages based on VB have also been created, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and VBScript. VBA is an event-driven programming language built into Microsoft Office, as well as several third-party applications.[3][4]VBA enables documents to contain macros used to automate the execution of tasks and other functionality on the host. VBScript is a default scripting language on Windows hosts and can also be used in place ofJavaScripton HTML Application (HTA) webpages served to Internet Explorer (though most modern browsers do not come with VBScript support).[5]Adversaries may use VB payloads to execute malicious commands. Common malicious usage includes automating execution of behaviors with VBScript or embedding VBA content intoSpearphishing Attachmentpayloads (which may also involveMark-of-the-Web Bypassto enable execution).[6]ID:T1059.005Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.4Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:07 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teaminstalled a VBA script calledvba_macro.exe.

Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to preventVisual Basicscripts from executing potentially malicious downloaded content[178].M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramTurn off or restrict access to unneeded VB components.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control where appropriate. VBA macros obtained from the Internet, based on the file's Mark of the Web (MOTW) attribute, may be blocked from executing in Office applications (ex: Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Word) by default starting in Windows Version 2203.[6]M1021Restrict Web-Based ContentScript blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of scripts and HTA files that may commonly be used during the exploitation process. For malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Visual Basic (VB) for execution.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor for the loading of modules associated with VB languages (ex: vbscript.dll).Note: For Windows, Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) can be used to alert on the loading of DLL modules (e.g., vbscript.dll) associated with Visual Basic into processes. Due to the high frequency of image load operations, Event ID 7 can generate a large volume of events. Therefore, we recommend tuning the Sysmon configuration file to exclude common, benign image loads that may result in false positives.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for events associated with VB execution, such as Office applications spawning processes, usage of the Windows Script Host (typically cscript.exe or wscript.exe). VB execution is likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used.DS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.Note: Be aware of VBScript execution from temporary or unusual file locations, which may indicate malicious activity.Analytic 1 - Script Execution from Temporary Locations(source=WinEventLog:"Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" EventID="4103") | WHERE CommandLine LIKE "AppData.vbs" OR CommandLine LIKE "AppData.vbe" OR CommandLine LIKE "AppData.vba"References.NET Team.
