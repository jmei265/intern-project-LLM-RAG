Examples of audio information adversaries may target include user conversations, surroundings, phone calls, or other sensitive information.Android and iOS, by default, require that applications request device microphone access from the user.On Android devices, applications must hold theRECORD_AUDIOpermission to access the microphone or theCAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUTpermission to access audio output. Because Android does not allow third-party applications to hold theCAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUTpermission by default, only privileged applications, such as those distributed by Google or the device vendor, can access audio output.[1]However, adversaries may be able to gain this access after successfully elevating their privileges. With theCAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUTpermission, adversaries may pass theMediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_CALLconstant toMediaRecorder.setAudioOutput, allowing capture of both voice call uplink and downlink.[2]On iOS devices, applications must include theNSMicrophoneUsageDescriptionkey in theirInfo.plistfile to access the microphone.[3]ID:T1429Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-19Version:3.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:16 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmucan grant itself microphone permissions.[4]S1095AhRatAhRatcan record audio using a device’s microphone.[5]S0292AndroRATAndroRATgathers audio from the microphone.[6][7]S0422AnubisAnubiscan record phone calls and audio.[8]S1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYcan access a device’s microphone to record audio, as well as cell and VoIP application calls.[9]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan record audio.[10]C0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto record phone calls.[11]S0529CarbonStealCarbonStealcan remotely capture device audio.[12]S0425Corona UpdatesCorona Updatescan record MP4 files and monitor calls.[13]S0301DendroidDendroidcan record audio and outgoing calls.[14]S0505Desert ScorpionDesert Scorpioncan record audio from phone calls and the device microphone.[15]S0550DoubleAgentDoubleAgenthas captured audio and can record phone calls.[12]S0320DroidJackDroidJackis capable of recording device phone calls.[16]S1092EscobarEscobarcan record audio from the device’s microphone.[17]S0507eSurveSurvcan record audio.[18]S0405ExodusExodusTwo can record audio from the compromised device's microphone and can record call audio in 3GP format.[19]S1080FakecallsFakecallscan turn on a device’s microphone to capture audio.[20]S0182FinFisherFinFisheruses the device microphone to record phone conversations.[21]S0408FlexiSpyFlexiSpycan record both incoming and outgoing phone calls, as well as microphone audio.[22]S0577FrozenCellFrozenCellhas recorded calls.[23]S0535Golden CupGolden Cupcan record audio from the microphone and phone calls.[24]S0551GoldenEagleGoldenEaglehas recorded calls and environment audio in .amr format.[12]S0421GolfSpyGolfSpycan record audio and phone calls.[25]S0544HenBoxHenBoxcan access the device’s microphone.[26]S1128HilalRATHilalRATcan activate a device’s microphone.[27]S1077HornbillHornbillcan record environmental and call audio.[28]S0407MonokleMonoklecan record audio from the device's microphone and can record phone calls, specifying the output audio quality.[29]S0399PallasPallascaptures audio from the device microphone.[21]S0316Pegasus for AndroidPegasus for Androidhas the ability to record device audio.[30]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOShas the ability to record audio.[31]S1126PhenakitePhenakitecan record phone calls.[32]S0295RCSAndroidRCSAndroidcan record audio using the device microphone.[33]S0326RedDropRedDropcaptures live recordings of the device's surroundings.[34]S0327SkygofreeSkygofreecan record audio via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location.[35]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealercan record phone calls and surrounding audio.[36]S0305SpyNote RATSpyNote RATcan activate the victim's microphone.[37]S0328Stealth MangoStealth Mangocan record audio using the device microphone.[38]S1082SunbirdSunbirdcan record environmental and call audio.[28]S0329TangeloTangelocontains functionality to record calls as well as the victim device's environment.[38]S1069TangleBotTangleBotcan record audio using the device microphone.[39]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Procan capture audio from the device’s microphone and can record phone calls.[40]S0418ViceLeakerViceLeakercan record audio from the device’s microphone and can record phone calls together with the caller ID.[41][42]S0506ViperRATViperRATcan collect and record audio content.[43]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas included phone call and audio recording capabilities in the malicious apps deployed as part of Operation BULL and Operation ROCK.[44]S0489WolfRATWolfRATcan record call audio.[45]S0318XLoader for AndroidXLoader for Androidcovertly records phone calls.[46]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionAndroid 9 and above restricts access to microphone, camera, and other sensors from background applications.[47]M1011User GuidanceUsers should be wary of granting applications dangerous or privacy-intrusive permissions, such as access to microphone or audio output.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingPermissions RequestsAndroid applications using theRECORD_AUDIOpermission and iOS applications usingRequestRecordPermissionshould be carefully reviewed and monitored. If theCAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUTpermission is found in a third-party Android application, the application should be heavily scrutinized.In both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can review which applications have the permission to access the microphone through the device settings screen and revoke permissions as necessary.DS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsIn iOS 14 and up, an orange dot (or orange square if the Differentiate Without Color setting is enabled) appears in the status bar when the microphone is being used by an application. However, there have been demonstrations indicating it may still be possible to access the microphone in the background without triggering this visual indicator by abusing features that natively access the microphone or camera but do not trigger the visual indicators.[48]In Android 12 and up, a green dot appears in the status bar when the microphone is being used by an application.[49]ReferencesGoogle.
