For example, passwords being copied and pasted from a password manager application could be captured by a malicious application installed on the device.[1]On Android, applications can use theClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener()API to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes. However, starting in Android 10, this can only be used if the application is in the foreground, or is set as the device’s default input method editor (IME).[2][3]On iOS, this can be accomplished by accessing theUIPasteboard.general.stringfield. However, starting in iOS 14, upon accessing the clipboard, the user will be shown a system notification if the accessed text originated in a different application. For example, if the user copies the text of an iMessage from the Messages application, the notification will read "application_name has pasted from Messages" when the text was pasted in a different application.[4]ID:T1414Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Collection,Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-35Version:3.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:16 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYcan collect clipboard data.[5]S0421GolfSpyGolfSpycan obtain clipboard contents.[6]S0295RCSAndroidRCSAndroidcan monitor clipboard content.[7]S0297XcodeGhostXcodeGhostcan read and write data in the user’s clipboard.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionAndroid 10 introduced changes to prevent applications from accessing clipboard data if they are not in the foreground or set as the device’s default IME.[3]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could detect usage of standard clipboard APIs.ReferencesFahl, S, et al..
