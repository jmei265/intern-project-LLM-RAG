Information about networks may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: IP ranges, domain names, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its topology and operations.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions viaActive ScanningorPhishing for Information. Information about networks may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Search Open Technical Databases).[1][2][3]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Active ScanningorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Acquire InfrastructureorCompromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex:Trusted Relationship).ID:T1590Sub-techniques:T1590.001,T1590.002,T1590.003,T1590.004,T1590.005,T1590.006ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMgathered the fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for targeted Exchange servers in the victim's environment.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesNTT America.
