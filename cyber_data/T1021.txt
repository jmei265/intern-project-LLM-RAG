The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).[1][2]They could also login to accessible SaaS or IaaS services, such as those that federate their identities to the domain.Legitimate applications (such asSoftware Deployment Toolsand other administrative programs) may utilizeRemote Servicesto access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend of protocols, includingVNCto send the screen and control buffers andSSHfor secure file transfer.[3][4][5]Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement. In versions of macOS prior to 10.14, an adversary can escalate an SSH session to an ARD session which enables an adversary to accept TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) prompts without user interaction and gain access to data.[6][7][4]ID:T1021Sub-techniques:T1021.001,T1021.002,T1021.003,T1021.004,T1021.005,T1021.006,T1021.007,T1021.008ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Active remote service accepting connections and valid credentialsContributors:Dan Borges, @1njectionVersion:1.5Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1063Brute Ratel C4Brute Ratel C4has the ability to use RPC for lateral movement.[8]S0437KivarsKivarshas the ability to remotely trigger keyboard input and mouse clicks.[9]S1016MacMaMacMacan manage remote screen sessions.[10]S0603StuxnetStuxnetcan propagate via peer-to-peer communication and updates using RPC.[11]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas used the WebDAV protocol to executeRyukpayloads hosted on network file shares.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditPerform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses.M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramIf remote services, such as the ability to make direct connections to cloud virtual machines, are not required, disable these connection types where feasible.M1035Limit Access to Resource Over NetworkPrevent access to file shares, remote access to systems, unnecessary services.

Ensure password complexity and uniqueness such that the passwords cannot be cracked or guessed.M1018User Account ManagementLimit the accounts that may use remote services. Limit the permissions for accounts that are at higher risk of compromise; for example, configure SSH so users can only run specific programs.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may useValid Accountsto log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or abnormal access patterns, such as multiple systems over a relatively short period of time. Correlate use of login activity related to remote services with unusual behavior or other malicious or suspicious activity. Adversaries will likely need to learn about an environment and the relationships between systems through Discovery techniques prior to attempting Lateral Movement. For example, in macOS you can review logs for "screensharingd" and "Authentication" event messages.[7][13]Note: When using Security event id 4624, %$ means user names that do not end with $ character. Usually, computer accounts or local system accounts names end with the $ character. When using Security event 4624, UserName and UserLogonId correspond to TargetUserName and TargetLogonId respectively. When using Security event 4624, LogonType 3 corresponds to a Network LogonAnalytic 1 - New services being created under network logon sessions by non-system users(source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4624") AND LogonType="3" AND UserName NOT '$' | rename UserLogonId AS LogonID| join type=inner LogonID[| search (source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4697") | rename UserLogonId as LogonID]DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes, that may useValid Accountsto log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.Note: On Windows, Sysmon Event ID 7 (Image loaded) can be used to monitor the loading of DLLs into processes, including those designed to accept remote connections. This is a particularly noisy event and can generate a large volume of data, so we recommend baselining and filtering out any known benign processes and module to help reduce the number of events that are produced.DS0033Network ShareNetwork Share AccessMonitor interactions with network shares, such as reads or file transfers, using remote services such as Server Message Block (SMB).DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may useValid Accountsto log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as RDP, telnet, SSH, and VNC. Monitor network connections involving common remote management protocols, such as ports tcp:3283 and tcp:5900, as well as ports tcp: 3389 and tcp:22 for remote login.Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows that may be related to abuse ofValid Accountsto log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as RDP, telnet, SSH, and VNC.Note: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on network service protocols such as SSH and RDP. #Protocol 6 = TCP #Protocol 17 = UDPAnalytic 1 - Suspicious Protocolssource="Zeek:" AND (port="636" AND protocol="6") OR (port="389" AND protocol="17")DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may useValid Accountsto log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as RDP, telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions that spawn additional processes as the logged-on user.Malicious actors may rename built-in commands or external tools, such as those provided by SysInternals, to better blend in with the environment. In those cases, the file path name is arbitrary and may blend in well with the background. If the arguments are closely inspected, it may be possible to infer what tools are running and understand what an adversary is doing. When any legitimate software shares the same command lines, it must be whitelisted according to the expected parameters.Any tool of interest with commonly known command line usage can be detecting by command line analysis. Known substrings of command lines includePuTTYport forwarding-R * -pwsecure copy (scp)-pw * *@mimikatzsekurlsa::RAR-hpArchive* a * Additionally, it may be useful to find IP addresses in the command line\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}Analytic 1 - Suspicious Arguments(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND CommandLine="-R .-pw" OR CommandLine="-pw ...@."
