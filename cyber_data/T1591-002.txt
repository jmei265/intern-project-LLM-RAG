Information about an organization’s business relationships may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access. This information may also reveal supply chains and shipment paths for the victim’s hardware and software resources.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation viaPhishing for Information. Information about business relationships may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites).[1]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Phishing for InformationorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Establish AccountsorCompromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:Supply Chain Compromise,Drive-by Compromise, orTrusted Relationship).ID:T1591.002Sub-technique of:T1591ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0035DragonflyDragonflyhas collected open source information to identify relationships between organizations for targeting purposes.[2]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has gathered detailed knowledge of an organization's supply chain relationships.[3]G0034Sandworm TeamIn preparation for its attack against the 2018 Winter Olympics,Sandworm Teamconducted online research of partner organizations listed on an official PyeongChang Olympics partnership site.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
