Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.[1][2][3]Default accounts are not limited to client machines, rather also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolenPrivate Keysor credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments viaRemote Services.[4]ID:T1078.001Sub-technique of:T1078ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserVersion:1.3Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:07 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1016FIN13FIN13has leveraged default credentials for authenticating myWebMethods (WMS) and QLogic web management interface to gain initial access.[5]S0537HyperStackHyperStackcan use default credentials to connect to IPC$ shares on remote machines.[6]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndenabled and used the default system managed account, DefaultAccount, via"powershell.exe" /c net user DefaultAccount /active:yesto connect to a targeted Exchange server over RDP.[7]S0603StuxnetStuxnetinfected WinCC machines via a hardcoded database server password.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1027Password PoliciesApplications and appliances that utilize default username and password should be changed immediately after the installation, and before deployment to a production environment.[9]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across default accounts that have been activated or logged into.
