Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network. Administrator or otherwise elevated access may provide better process details. Adversaries may use the information fromProcess Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.In Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using theTasklistutility viacmdorGet-ProcessviaPowerShell. Information about processes can also be extracted from the output ofNative APIcalls such asCreateToolhelp32Snapshot. In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with thepscommand. Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via/proc.On network devices,Network Device CLIcommands such asshow processescan be used to display current running processes.[1][2]ID:T1057Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defenseVersion:1.5Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:16
