Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition.[1]Within MFT entries are file attributes,[2]such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data [known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files).[1][3][4][5]Adversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus.[6][4]ID:T1564.004Sub-technique of:T1564ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSystem Requirements:NTFS partitioned hard driveⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Host forensic analysis, Signature-based detectionContributors:Oddvar Moe, @oddvarmoe; Red CanaryVersion:1.1Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:14 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0504AnchorAnchorhas used NTFS to hide files.[7]G0050APT32APT32used NTFS alternate data streams to hide their payloads.[8]S0373AstarothAstarothcan abuse alternate data streams (ADS) to store content for malicious payloads.[9]S0570BitPaymerBitPaymerhas copied itself to the:binalternate data stream of a newly created file.[10]S1052DEADEYEThe DEADEYE.EMBED variant ofDEADEYEcan embed its payload in an alternate data stream of a local file.[11]S0404esentutlesentutlcan be used to read and write alternate data streams.[12]S0361ExpandExpandcan be used to download or copy a file into an alternate data stream.[13]S0168GazerGazerstores configuration items in alternate data streams (ADSs) if the Registry is not accessible.[14]S0397LoJaxLoJaxhas loaded an embedded NTFS DXE driver to be able to access and write to NTFS partitions.[15]S0139PowerDukePowerDukehides many of its backdoor payloads in an alternate data stream (ADS).[16]S0145POWERSOURCEIf the victim is using PowerShell 3.0 or later,POWERSOURCEwrites its decoded payload to an alternate data stream (ADS) named kernel32.dll that is saved in%PROGRAMDATA%\Windows\.[17]S0019ReginTheReginmalware platform uses Extended Attributes to store encrypted executables.[18]S0476ValakValakhas the ability save and execute files as alternate data streams (ADS).[19][20][21]S0612WastedLockerWastedLockerhas the ability to save and execute files as an alternate data stream (ADS).[22]S0027ZeroaccessSome variants of theZeroaccessTrojan have been known to store data in Extended Attributes.[23]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsConsider adjusting read and write permissions for NTFS EA, though this should be tested to ensure routine OS operations are not impeded.[24]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionThe Streams tool of Sysinternals can be used to uncover files with ADSs. Thedir /rcommand can also be used to display ADSs.[25]Many PowerShell commands (such as Get-Item, Set-Item, Remove-Item, and Get-ChildItem) can also accept a-streamparameter to interact with ADSs.[4][5]DS0022FileFile MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Forensic techniques exist to identify information stored in NTFS EA.[6]File ModificationThere are many ways to create and interact with ADSs using Windows utilities. Monitor for operations (execution, copies, etc.) with file names that contain colons. This syntax (ex:file.ext:ads[.ext]) is commonly associated with ADSs.[5][26][27]For a more exhaustive list of utilities that can be used to execute and create ADSs, see https://gist.github.com/api0cradle/cdd2d0d0ec9abb686f0e89306e277b8f.DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor calls to theZwSetEaFileandZwQueryEaFileWindows API functions as well as binaries used to interact with EA,[26][27]and consider regularly scanning for the presence of modified information.[1]Process CreationMonitor for process execution that may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection.Analytic 1 - NTFS Alternate Data Stream Execution : System Utilities (Powershell)(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image= "C:\Windows\\powershell.exe" | regex CommandLine= "Invoke-CimMethod\s+-ClassName\s+Win32_Process\s+-MethodName\s+Create.\b(\w+(.\w+)?):(\w+(.\w+)?)|-ep bypass\s+-\s+<.\b(\w+(.\w+)?):(\w+(.\w+)?)|-command.Get-Content.-Stream.Set-Content.start-process .(\w+(.\w+)?)"Analytic 2 - NTFS Alternate Data Stream Execution : System Utilities (WMIC)(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image= "C:\Windows\\wmic.exe" | regex CommandLine= "process call create.\"(\w+(.\w+)?):(\w+(.\w+)?)"Analytic 3 - NTFS Alternate Data Stream Execution : System Utilities (rundll32)(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image= "C:\Windows\\rundll32.exe" | regex CommandLine= "\"?(\w+(.\w+)?):(\w+(.\w+)?)?\"?,\w+\|(advpack.dll\|ieadvpack.dll),RegisterOCX\s+(\w+.\w+):(\w+(.\w+)?)\|(shdocvw.dll\|ieframe.dll),OpenURL.(\w+.\w+):(\w+(.\w+)?)"Analytic 4 - NTFS Alternate Data Stream Execution : System Utilities (wscript/cscript)(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image= "C:\Windows\\wscript.exe" OR Image= "C:\Windows\\cscript.exe)" | regex CommandLine= "(?<!\/)\b\w+(.\w+)?:\w+(.\w+)?$"ReferencesAtkinson, J.
