With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.[1][2][3][4][5]In addition to user accounts, cloud accounts may be associated with services. Cloud providers handle the concept of service accounts in different ways. In Azure, service accounts include service principals and managed identities, which can be linked to various resources such as OAuth applications, serverless functions, and virtual machines in order to grant those resources permissions to perform various activities in the environment.[6]In GCP, service accounts can also be linked to specific resources, as well as be impersonated by other accounts forTemporary Elevated Cloud Access.[7]While AWS has no specific concept of service accounts, resources can be directly granted permission to assume roles.[8][9]Adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific cloud services, which can reduce the chance of detection.Once an adversary has created a cloud account, they can then manipulate that account to ensure persistence and allow access to additional resources - for example, by addingAdditional Cloud Credentialsor assigningAdditional Cloud Roles.ID:T1136.003Sub-technique of:T1136ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); PraetorianVersion:1.5Created:29 January 2020Last Modified:28 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan create new Azure AD users.[10]G0016APT29APT29can create new users through Azure AD.[11]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has created global admin accounts in the targeted organization's cloud instances to gain persistence.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.M1030Network SegmentationConfigure access controls and firewalls to limit access to critical systems and domain controllers.
