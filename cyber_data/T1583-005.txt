A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.[1]Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scalePhishingor Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).[2][3][4][5]ID:T1583.005Sub-technique of:T1583ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as duringPhishing,Endpoint Denial of Service, orNetwork Denial of Service.ReferencesNorton. (n.d.).
