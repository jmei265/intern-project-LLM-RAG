Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.ID:T1573Sub-techniques:T1573.001,T1573.002ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:16 March 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has used multiple layers of encryption within malware to protect C2 communication.[1]G1002BITTERBITTERhas encrypted their C2 communications.[2]S0631ChaesChaeshas used encryption for its C2 channel.[3]S0498CryptoisticCryptoisticcan engage in encrypted communications with C2.[4]S0032gh0st RATgh0st RAThas encrypted TCP communications to evade detection.[5]S0681LizarLizarcan support encrypted communications between the client and server.[6][7]S1016MacMaMacMahas used TLS encryption to initialize a custom protocol for C2 communications.[8]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas used an encrypted http proxy in C2 communications.[9]S0198NETWIRENETWIREcan encrypt C2 communications.[10]S1012PowerLessPowerLesscan use an encrypted channel for C2 communications.[11]S1046PowGoopPowGoopcan receive encrypted commands from C2.[12]S0662RCSessionRCSessioncan use an encrypted beacon to check in with C2.[13]C0030Triton Safety Instrumented System AttackIn theTriton Safety Instrumented System Attack,TEMP.Velesused cryptcat binaries to encrypt their traffic.[14]G0081Tropic TrooperTropic Trooperhas encrypted traffic with the C2 to prevent network detection.[15]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.M1020SSL/TLS InspectionSSL/TLS inspection can be used to see the contents of encrypted sessions to look for network-based indicators of malware communication protocols.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesSecureworks CTU.
