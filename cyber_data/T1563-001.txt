Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.[1][2][3][4]SSH Hijackingdiffers from use ofSSHbecause it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session usingValid Accounts.ID:T1563.001Sub-technique of:T1563ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Linux, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:SSH service enabled, trust relationships configured, established connectionsⓘPermissions Required:rootContributors:Anastasios PingiosVersion:1.0Created:25 February 2020Last Modified:23 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramEnsure that agent forwarding is disabled on systems that do not explicitly require this feature to prevent misuse.[5]M1027Password PoliciesEnsure SSH key pairs have strong passwords and refrain from using key-store technologies such as ssh-agent unless they are properly protected.M1026Privileged Account ManagementDo not allow remote access via SSH as root or other privileged accounts.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsEnsure proper file permissions are set and harden system to prevent root privilege escalation opportunities.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time. Also monitor user SSH-agent socket files being used by different users.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment.ReferencesDuarte, H., Morrison, B.
