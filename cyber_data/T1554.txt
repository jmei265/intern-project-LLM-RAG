Software binaries/executables provide a wide range of system commands or services, programs, and libraries. Common software binaries are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, web browsers, and many other user or server applications.Adversaries may establish persistence though modifications to host software binaries. For example, an adversary may replace or otherwise infect a legitimate application binary (or support files) with a backdoor. Since these binaries may be routinely executed by applications or the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host.An adversary may also modify an existing binary by patching in malicious functionality (e.g., IAT Hooking/Entry point patching)[1]prior to the binary’s legitimate execution. For example, an adversary may modify the entry point of a binary to point to malicious code patched in by the adversary before resuming normal execution flow.[2]ID:T1554Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatchVersion:2.0Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused a trojanized version of Windows Notepad to add a layer of persistence forIndustroyer.[3]G1023APT5APT5has modified legitimate binaries and scripts for Pulse Secure VPNs including the legitimate DSUpgrade.pm file to install the ATRIUM webshell for persistence.[4][5]S0486BonadanBonadanhas maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.[6]S1118BUSHWALKBUSHWALKcan embed into the legitimatequerymanifest.cgifile on compromised Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs.[7][8]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors trojanized legitimate files in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances with malicious code.[9][10][7]S0377EburyEburyhas been embedded into modified OpenSSH binaries to gain persistent access to SSH credential information.[11]S1120FRAMESTINGFRAMESTINGcan embed itself in the CAV Python package of an Ivanti Connect Secure VPN located in/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cav-0.1-py3.6.egg/cav/api/resources/category.py.[7]S0604IndustroyerIndustroyerhas used a Trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application for an additional backdoor persistence mechanism.[3]S0487KesselKesselhas maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.[6]S0641KobalosKobalosreplaced the SSH client with a trojanized SSH client to steal credentials on compromised systems.[12]S1119LIGHTWIRELIGHTWIREcan imbed itself into the legitimatecompcheckresult.cgicomponent of Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs to enable command execution.[9][7]S1121LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEALITTLELAMB.WOOLTEAcan append malicious components to thetmp/tmpmnt/bin/samba_upgrade.tararchive inside the factory reset partition in attempt to persist post reset.[8]S1104SLOWPULSESLOWPULSEis applied in compromised environments through modifications to legitimate Pulse Secure files.[5]S0595ThiefQuestThiefQuestsearches through the/Users/folder looking for executable files.
