Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.[1][2][3][4][5][6]Common operating system file deletion commands such asdelandrmoften only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct fromDisk Content WipeandDisk Structure Wipebecause individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.[4][5]In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.[2][3][4]To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques likeValid Accounts,OS Credential Dumping, andSMB/Windows Admin Shares.[1][2][3][4][6].In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.[7][8]ID:T1485Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Containers, IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityContributors:Brent Murphy, Elastic;
