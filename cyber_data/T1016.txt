Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples includeArp,ipconfig/ifconfig,nbtstat, androute.Adversaries may also leverage aNetwork Device CLIon network devices to gather information about configurations and settings, such as IP addresses of configured interfaces and static/dynamic routes (e.g.show ip route,show ip interface).[1][2]Adversaries may use the information fromSystem Network Configuration Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do
