An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started. This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications. This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.[1][2]There exist user and global Registry keys for the Office Test feature, such as:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\PerfHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\PerfAdversaries may add this Registry key and specify a malicious DLL that will be executed whenever an Office application, such as Word or Excel, is started.ID:T1137.002Sub-technique of:T1137ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Office 365, WindowsVersion:1.2Created:07 November 2019Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used the Office Test persistence mechanism within Microsoft Office by adding the Registry keyHKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perfto execute code.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Office applications from creating child processes and from writing potentially malicious executable content to disk.[3]M1054Software ConfigurationCreate the Registry key used to execute it and set the permissions to "Read Control" to prevent easy access to the key without administrator permissions or requiring Privilege Escalation.[2]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system.DS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files that may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system.File ModificationMonitor for changes made to files that may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes.
