In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment. In Kubernetes environments, an adversary may attempt to deploy a privileged or vulnerable container into a specific node in order toEscape to Hostand access other containers running on the node.[1]Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker'screateandstartAPIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow.[2][3][4]In Kubernetes environments, containers may be deployed through workloads such as ReplicaSets or DaemonSets, which can allow containers to be deployed across multiple nodes.[5]Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.[6]ID:T1610Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,ExecutionⓘPlatforms:ContainersⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; Ariel Shuper, Cisco; Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID); Idan Frimark, Cisco; Joas Antonio dos Santos, @C0d3Cr4zy; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Pawan Kinger, @kingerpawan, Trend Micro; Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:1.3Created:29 March 2021Last Modified:11 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0600DokiDokiwas run through a deployed container.[7]S0599KinsingKinsingwas run through a deployed Ubuntu container.[8]S0683PeiratesPeiratescan deploy a pod that mounts its node’s root file system, then execute a command to create a reverse shell on the node.[9]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas deployed different types of containers into victim environments to facilitate execution.[10][11]TeamTNThas also transferred cryptocurrency mining software to Kubernetes clusters discovered within local IP address ranges.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditScan images before deployment, and block those that are not in compliance with security policies. In Kubernetes environments, the admission controller can be used to validate images after a container deployment request is authenticated but before the container is deployed.[13]M1035Limit Access to Resource Over NetworkLimit communications with the container service to managed and secured channels, such as local Unix sockets or remote access via SSH. Require secure port access to communicate with the APIs over TLS by disabling unauthenticated access to the Docker API, Kubernetes API Server, and container orchestration web applications.[14][15]In Kubernetes clusters deployed in cloud environments, use native cloud platform features to restrict the IP ranges that are permitted to access to API server.[16]Where possible, consider enabling just-in-time (JIT) access to the Kubernetes API to place additional restrictions on access.[17]M1030Network SegmentationDeny direct remote access to internal systems through the use of network proxies, gateways, and firewalls.M1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least privilege by limiting container dashboard access to only the necessary users. When using Kubernetes, avoid giving users wildcard permissions or adding users to thesystem:mastersgroup, and useRoleBindingsrather thanClusterRoleBindingsto limit user privileges to specific namespaces.[18]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentConfiguration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network.DS0032ContainerContainer CreationMonitor for newly constructed containers that may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.Container StartMonitor for activation or invocation of a container that may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.DS0014PodPod CreationMonitor for newly constructed pods that may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.Pod ModificationMonitor for changes made to pods for unexpected modifications to settings and/or control data that may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses.ReferencesAbhisek Datta.
