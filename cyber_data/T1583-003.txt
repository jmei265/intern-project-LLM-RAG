There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.[1]ID:T1583.003Sub-technique of:T1583ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28hosted phishing domains on free services for brief periods of time during campaigns.[2]G0001AxiomAxiomhas used VPS hosting providers in targeting of intended victims.[3]C0032C0032During theC0032campaign,TEMP.Velesused Virtual Private Server (VPS) infrastructure.[4]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas acquired VPS infrastructure for use in malicious campaigns.[5]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas operated from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States.[6]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has used VPS hosting providers for infrastructure.[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned a VPS (ex: for use as a command and control server), internet scans may reveal servers that adversaries have acquired. Consider looking for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software.[8][9][10]Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult.
