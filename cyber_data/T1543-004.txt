Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/and/Library/LaunchDaemons/. Required Launch Daemons parameters include aLabelto identify the task,Programto provide a path to the executable, andRunAtLoadto specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.[1][2][3]Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using theRunAtLoadparameter set totrueand theProgramparameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software (i.e.Masquerading). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.[4][5]Additionally, system configuration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such asusr/local/binto become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify executables referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist files.[6][7]ID:T1543.004Sub-technique of:T1543ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:macOSⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorⓘEffective Permissions:Administrator, rootVersion:1.2Created:17 January 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas placed a plist file within theLaunchDaemonsfolder and launched it manually.[8][9]S0482BundloreBundlorecan persist via a LaunchDaemon.[10]S1105COATHANGERCOATHANGERwill create a daemon for timed check-ins with command and control infrastructure.[11]S0497DaclsDaclscan establish persistence via a Launch Daemon.[12][13]S0690Green LambertGreen Lambertcan add a plist file in theLibrary/LaunchDaemonsto establish persistence.[14][15]S0451LoudMinerLoudMineradds plist files with the naming formatcom.[random_name].plistin the/Library/LaunchDaemonsfolder with the RunAtLoad and KeepAlive keys set totrue.[16]S0352OSX_OCEANLOTUS.DIf running withrootpermissions,OSX_OCEANLOTUS.Dcan create a persistence file in the folder/Library/LaunchDaemons.[17][18]S0595ThiefQuestWhen running with root privileges after aLaunch Agentis installed,ThiefQuestinstalls a plist file to the/Library/LaunchDaemons/folder with theRunAtLoadkey set totrueestablishing persistence as a Launch Daemon.[19]S0658XCSSETXCSSETuses the ssh launchdaemon to elevate privileges, bypass system controls, and enable remote access to the victim.[20]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditUse auditing tools capable of detecting folder permissions abuse opportunities on systems, especially reviewing changes made to folders by third-party software.M1018User Account ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts and remediate Privilege Escalation vectors so only authorized administrators can create new Launch Daemons.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionSome legitimate LaunchDaemons point to unsigned code that could be exploited.
