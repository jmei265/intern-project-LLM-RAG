Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover user, administrator, and service accounts. With a sufficient level of access, thenet user /add /domaincommand can be used to create a domain account.[1]Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.ID:T1136.002Sub-technique of:T1136ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:28 January 2020Last Modified:01 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamcreated privileged domain accounts to be used for further exploitation and lateral movement.[2]C00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamcreated two new accounts, "admin" and "система" (System).
