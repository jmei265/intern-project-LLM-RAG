Many libraries exist that can archive data, includingPythonrarfile[1], libzip[2], and zlib[3]. Most libraries include functionality to encrypt and/or compress data.Some archival libraries are preinstalled on systems, such as bzip2 on macOS and Linux, and zip on Windows. Note that the libraries are different from the utilities. The libraries can be linked against when compiling, while the utilities require spawning a subshell, or a similar execution mechanism.ID:T1560.002Sub-technique of:T1560ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:20 February 2020Last Modified:29 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0642BADFLICKBADFLICKhas compressed data using the aPLib compression library.[4]S0127BBSRATBBSRATcan compress data with ZLIB prior to sending it back to the C2 server.[5]S0348Cardinal RATCardinal RATapplies compression to C2 traffic using the ZLIB library.[6]S0354DenisDeniscompressed collected data using zlib.[7]S0091EpicEpiccompresses the collected data with bzip2 before sending it to the C2 server.[8]S0661FoggyWebFoggyWebcan invoke theCommon.Compressmethod to compress data with the C# GZipStream compression class.[9]S1044FunnyDreamFunnyDreamhas compressed collected files with zLib.[10]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan use zlib to compress and decompress data.[11][12]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Groupmalware IndiaIndia saves information gathered about the victim to a file that is compressed with Zlib, encrypted, and uploaded to a C2 server.[13][14]S0352OSX_OCEANLOTUS.DOSX_OCEANLOTUS.Dscrambles and encrypts data using AES256 before sending it to the C2 server.[15][16]S0053SeaDukeSeaDukecompressed data with zlib prior to sending it over C2.[17]S0467TajMahalTajMahalhas the ability to use the open source libraries XZip/Xunzip and zlib to compress files.[18]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has used RAR to compress, encrypt, and password-protect files prior to exfiltration.[19]S0086ZLibTheZLibbackdoor compresses communications using the standard Zlib compression library.[20]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Detection efforts may focus on follow-on exfiltration activity, where compressed or encrypted files can be detected in transit with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers.DS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.Referencesmkz. (2020). rarfile 3.1. Retrieved February 20, 2020.D. Baron, T. Klausner.
