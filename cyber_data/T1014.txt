Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information.[1]Rootkits or rootkit enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system or lower, to include a hypervisor, Master Boot Record, orSystem Firmware.[2]Rootkits have been seen for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X systems.[3][4]ID:T1014Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application Control, File Monitoring, Host Intrusion Prevention Systems, Signature-based Detection, System Access ControlsVersion:1.1Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) rootkit known asLoJax.[5][6]G0096APT41APT41deployed rootkits on Linux systems.[7][8]S0484CarberpCarberphas used user mode rootkit techniques to remain hidden on the system.[9]S0572Caterpillar WebShellCaterpillar WebShellhas a module to use a rootkit on a system.[10]S1105COATHANGERCOATHANGERhooks or replaces multiple legitimate processes and other functions on victim devices.[11]S0502DrovorubDrovorubhas used a kernel module rootkit to hide processes, files, executables, and network artifacts from user space view.[12]S0377EburyEburyhas used user mode rootkit techniques to remain hidden on the system.[13]S0047Hacking Team UEFI RootkitHacking Team UEFI Rootkitis a UEFI BIOS rootkit developed by the company Hacking Team to persist remote access software on some targeted systems.[14]S0394HiddenWaspHiddenWaspuses a rootkit to hook and implement functions on the system.[15]S0135HIDEDRVHIDEDRVis a rootkit that hides certain operating system artifacts.[16]S0009HikitHikitis aRootkitthat has been used byAxiom.[17][18]S0601HildegardHildegardhas modified /etc/ld.so.preload to overwrite readdir() and readdir64().[19]S0040HTRANHTRANcan install a rootkit to hide network connections from the host OS.[20]S0397LoJaxLoJaxis a UEFI BIOS rootkit deployed to persist remote access software on some targeted systems.[6]S0012PoisonIvyPoisonIvystarts a rootkit from a malicious file dropped to disk.[21]S0458RamsayRamsayhas included a rootkit to evade defenses.[22]G0106RockeRockehas modified /etc/ld.so.preload to hook libc functions in order to hide the installed dropper and mining software in process lists.[23]S0468SkidmapSkidmapis a kernel-mode rootkit that has the ability to hook system calls to hide specific files and fake network and CPU-related statistics to make the CPU load of the infected machine always appear low.[24]S0603StuxnetStuxnetuses a Windows rootkit to mask its binaries and other relevant files.[25]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas used rootkits such as the open-source Diamorphine rootkit and their custom bots to hide cryptocurrency mining activities on the machine.[26][27]S0221UmbreonUmbreonhides from defenders by hooking libc function calls, hiding artifacts that would reveal its presence, such as the user account it creates to provide access and undermining strace, a tool often used to identify malware.[28]S0022UroburosUroburoscan use its kernel module to prevent its host components from being listed by the targeted system's OS and to mediate requests between user mode and concealed components.[29][30]S0670WarzoneRATWarzoneRATcan include a rootkit to hide processes, files, and startup.[31]S0430Winnti for LinuxWinnti for Linuxhas used a modified copy of the open-source userland rootkit Azazel, named libxselinux.so, to hide the malware's operations and network activity.[32]G0044Winnti GroupWinnti Groupused a rootkit to modify typical server functionality.[33]S0027ZeroaccessZeroaccessis a kernel-mode rootkit.[34]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Some rootkit protections may be built into anti-virus or operating system software. There are dedicated rootkit detection tools that look for specific types of rootkit behavior.ReferencesSymantec.
