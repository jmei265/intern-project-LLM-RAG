Search engines typically display results to users based on purchased ads as well as the site’s ranking/score/reputation calculated by their web crawlers and algorithms.[1][2]To help facilitateDrive-by Compromise, adversaries may stage content that explicitly manipulates SEO rankings in order to promote sites hosting their malicious payloads (such asDrive-by Target) within search engines. Poisoning SEO rankings may involve various tricks, such as stuffing keywords (including in the form of hidden text) into compromised sites. These keywords could be related to the interests/browsing habits of the intended victim(s) as well as more broad, seasonably popular topics (e.g. elections, trending news).[3][1]Adversaries may also purchase or plant incoming links to staged capabilities in order to boost the site’s calculated relevance and reputation.[2][4]SEO poisoning may also be combined with evasive redirects and other cloaking mechanisms (such as measuring mouse movements or serving content based on browser user agents, user language/localization settings, or HTTP headers) in order to feed SEO inputs while avoiding scrutiny from defenders.[3][5]ID:T1608.006Sub-technique of:T1608ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Hiroki Nagahama, NEC Corporation; Manikantan Srinivasan, NEC Corporation India; Pooja Natarajan, NEC Corporation India; Vijay Lalwani; Will Jolliffe; Will Thomas, Equinix Threat Analysis Center (ETAC)Version:1.0Created:30 September 2022Last Modified:13 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1020Mustard TempestMustard Tempesthas poisoned search engine results to return fake software updates in order to distribute malware.[6][7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in the malicious web content related to SEO poisoning orDrive-by Targethave been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged web content supporting a strategic web compromise. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult.
