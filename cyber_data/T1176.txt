Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.[1][2]Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.[3]Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using theprofilestool to install malicious.mobileconfigfiles. In macOS 11+, the use of theprofilestool can no longer install configuration profiles, however.mobileconfigfiles can be planted and installed with user interaction.[4]Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.[5][6][7][8]There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions forCommand and Control.[9][10]Adversaries may also use browser extensions to modify browser permissions and components, privacy settings, and other security controls forDefense Evasion.[11][12]ID:T1176Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Chris Ross @xorrior; Justin Warner, ICEBRG; Manikantan Srinivasan, NEC Corporation IndiaVersion:1.3Created:16 January 2018Last Modified:18 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0482BundloreBundlorecan install malicious browser extensions that are used to hijack user searches.[13]S0531GrandoreiroGrandoreirocan use malicious browser extensions to steal cookies and other user information.[14]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used Google Chrome browser extensions to infect victims and to steal passwords and cookies.[15][16]S1122MispaduMispaduutilizes malicious Google Chrome browser extensions to steal financial data.[17]S0402OSX/ShlayerOSX/Shlayercan install malicious Safari browser extensions to serve ads.[18][19]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditEnsure extensions that are installed are the intended ones as many malicious extensions will masquerade as legitimate ones.M1038Execution PreventionSet a browser extension allow or deny list as appropriate for your security policy.[20]M1033Limit Software InstallationOnly install browser extensions from trusted sources that can be verified.
