Information about domains and their properties may include a variety of details, including what domain(s) the victim owns as well as administrative data (ex: name, registrar, etc.) and more directly actionable information such as contacts (email addresses and phone numbers), business addresses, and name servers.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions viaActive ScanningorPhishing for Information. Information about victim domains and their properties may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:WHOIS).[1][2][3]Where third-party cloud providers are in use, this information may also be exposed through publicly available API endpoints, such as GetUserRealm and autodiscover in Office 365 environments.[4][5]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Technical Databases,Search Open Websites/Domains, orPhishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex:Acquire InfrastructureorCompromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex:Phishing).ID:T1590.001Sub-technique of:T1590ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)Version:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan gather information about a tenant’s domains using public Microsoft APIs.[6][7]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamconducted technical reconnaissance of the Parliament of Georgia's official internet domain prior to its 2019 attack.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesNTT America.
