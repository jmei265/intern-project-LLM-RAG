A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services.[1]Some infrastructure providers offer free trial periods, enabling infrastructure acquisition at limited to no cost.[2]Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.Use of these infrastructure solutions allows adversaries to stage, launch, and execute operations. Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contacting third-party web services or acquiring infrastructure to supportProxy, including from residential proxy services.[3][4][5]Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.ID:T1583Sub-techniques:T1583.001,T1583.002,T1583.003,T1583.004,T1583.005,T1583.006,T1583.007,T1583.008ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Shailesh Tiwary (Indian Army)Version:1.4Created:30 September 2020Last Modified:28 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamused various third-party email campaign management services to deliver phishing emails.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0038Domain NameActive DNSMonitor for queried domain name system (DNS) registry data that may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.Domain RegistrationConsider use of services that may aid in tracking of newly acquired infrastructure, such as WHOIS databases for domain registration information.

Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.DS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned infrastructure (ex: a server for use in command and control), internet scans may help proactively discover adversary acquired infrastructure. Consider looking for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software.[7][8][9]Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.Response MetadataMonitor for contextual data about an Internet-facing resource gathered from a scan, such as running services or ports that may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.ReferencesMax Goncharov. (2015, July 15).
