Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.Credential stuffing is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuffing credentials. Commonly targeted services include the following:SSH (22/TCP)Telnet (23/TCP)FTP (21/TCP)NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)LDAP (389/TCP)Kerberos (88/TCP)RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)MSSQL (1433/TCP)Oracle (1521/TCP)MySQL (3306/TCP)VNC (5900/TCP)In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.[1]ID:T1110.004Sub-technique of:T1110ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Anastasios Pingios; Diogo FernandesVersion:1.5Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:07 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0114ChimeraChimerahas used credential stuffing against victim's remote services to obtain valid accounts.[2]S0266TrickBotTrickBotuses brute-force attack against RDP with rdpscanDll module.[3][4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1036Account Use PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.[5]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[6]M1018User Account ManagementProactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures ofValid Accounts.
