There are also specific applications and services that store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.ID:T1555Sub-techniques:T1555.001,T1555.002,T1555.003,T1555.004,T1555.005,T1555.006ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.2Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:26 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas the ability to steal credentials from FTP clients and wireless profiles.[2]G0064APT33APT33has used a variety of publicly available tools likeLaZagneto gather credentials.[3][4]G0087APT39APT39has used the Smartftp Password Decryptor tool to decrypt FTP passwords.[5]S0373AstarothAstarothuses an external software known as NetPass to recover passwords.[6]S0484CarberpCarberp's passw.plug plugin can gather account information from multiple instant messaging, email, and social media services, as well as FTP, VNC, and VPN clients.[7]S0050CosmicDukeCosmicDukecollects user credentials, including passwords, for various programs including popular instant messaging applications and email clients as well as WLAN keys.[1]S1111DarkGateDarkGateuse Nirsoft Network Password Recovery or NetPass tools to steal stored RDP credentials in some malware versions.[8]G0120EvilnumEvilnumcan collect email credentials from victims.[9]G0037FIN6FIN6has used the Stealer One credential stealer to target e-mail and file transfer utilities including FTP.[10]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas runcmdkeyon victim machines to identify stored credentials.[11]S0526KGH_SPYKGH_SPYcan collect credentials from WINSCP.[12]S0349LaZagneLaZagnecan obtain credentials from databases, mail, and WiFi across multiple platforms.[13]G0077LeafminerLeafminerused several tools for retrieving login and password information, including LaZagne.[14]S0447LokibotLokibothas stolen credentials from multiple applications and data sources including Windows OS credentials, email clients, FTP, and SFTP clients.[15]G1026MalteiroMalteirohas obtained credentials from mail clients via NirSoft MailPassView.[16]S0167MatryoshkaMatryoshkais capable of stealing Outlook passwords.[17][18]S0002MimikatzMimikatzperforms credential dumping to obtain account and password information useful in gaining access to additional systems and enterprise network resources.

This increases the complexity for an adversary because they need to know an additional password.Organizations may consider weighing the risk of storing credentials in password stores and web browsers. If system, software, or web browser credential disclosure is a significant concern, technical controls, policy, and user training may be used to prevent storage of credentials in improper locations.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit the number of accounts and services with permission to query information from password stores to only those required. Ensure that accounts and services with permissions to query password stores only have access to the secrets they require.M1051Update SoftwarePerform regular software updates to mitigate exploitation risk.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0025Cloud ServiceCloud Service EnumerationMonitor for API calls and CLI commands that attempt to enumerate and fetch credential material from cloud secrets managers, such asget-secret-valuein AWS,gcloud secrets describein GCP, andaz key vault secret showin Azure.
