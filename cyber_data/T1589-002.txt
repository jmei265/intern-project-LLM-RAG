Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-facing email infrastructure and addresses for employees.Adversaries may easily gather email addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites).[1][2]Email addresses could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e.Active Scanning), such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system.[3]For example, adversaries may be able to enumerate email addresses in Office 365 environments by querying a variety of publicly available API endpoints, such as autodiscover and GetCredentialType.[4][5]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorPhishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex:Email Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:PhishingorBrute ForceviaExternal Remote Services).ID:T1589.002Sub-technique of:T1589ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)Version:1.2Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan check for the existence of user email addresses using public Microsoft APIs.[6][7]G0050APT32APT32has collected e-mail addresses for activists and bloggers in order to target them with spyware.[8]G1011EXOTIC LILYEXOTIC LILYhas gathered targeted individuals' e-mail addresses through open source research and website contact forms.[9]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas collected e-mail addresses for users they intended to target.[10]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas targeted executives, human resources staff, and IT personnel for spearphishing.[11][12]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas collected valid email addresses that were subsequently used in spearphishing campaigns.[13]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has gathered employee email addresses, including personal accounts, for social engineering and initial access efforts.[14]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Groupcollected email addresses belonging to various departments of a targeted organization which were used in follow-on phishing campaigns.[15]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas identified high-value email accounts in academia, journalism, NGO's, foreign policy, and national security for targeting.[16][17]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas obtained valid emails addresses while conducting research against target organizations that were subsequently used in spearphishing campaigns.[18]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas collected e-mail addresses from targeted organizations from open Internet searches.[19]G0127TA551TA551has used spoofed company emails that were acquired from email clients on previously infected hosts to target other individuals.[20]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor for suspicious network traffic that could be indicative of probing for email addresses and/or usernames, such as large/iterative quantities of authentication requests originating from a single source (especially if the source is known to be associated with an adversary/botnet). Analyzing web metadata may also reveal artifacts that can be attributed to potentially malicious activity, such as referer or user-agent string HTTP/S fields.ReferencesHackers Arise. (n.d.).
