Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds. They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket. Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or credentials contained within software's source code.  Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to developExploits, while credentials may provide access to additional resources usingValid Accounts.[1][2]Note:This is distinct fromCode Repositories, which focuses on conductingReconnaissancevia public code repositories.ID:T1213.003Sub-technique of:T1213ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:SaaSContributors:Itamar Mizrahi, Cymptom; Josh Liburdi, @jshlbrd; Toby KohlenbergVersion:1.1Created:11 May 2021Last Modified:18 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41APT41cloned victim user Git repositories during intrusions.[3]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has searched a victim's network for code repositories like GitLab and GitHub to discover further high-privilege account credentials.[4][5]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderenumerates data stored within victim code repositories, such as internal GitHub repositories.[6][7]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29downloaded source code from code repositories.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditConsider periodic reviews of accounts and privileges for critical and sensitive code repositories.

Monitor access to code repositories, especially performed by privileged users such as Active Directory Domain or Enterprise Administrators as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access code repositories. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user-based anomalies.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across code repositories (e.g. Github) which can be configured to report access to certain pages and documents.ReferencesAndy Greenberg.
