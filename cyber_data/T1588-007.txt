These tools may be used to inform, bolster, and enable a variety of malicious tasks including conductingReconnaissance, creating basic scripts, assisting social engineering, and even developing payloads.[1]For example, by utilizing a publicly available LLM an adversary is essentially outsourcing or automating certain tasks to the tool. Using AI, the adversary may draft and generate content in a variety of written languages to be used inPhishing/Phishing for Informationcampaigns. The same publicly available tool may further enable vulnerability or other offensive research supportingDevelop Capabilities. AI tools may also automate technical tasks by generating, refining, or otherwise enhancing (e.g.,Obfuscated Files or Information) malicious scripts and payloads.[2]ID:T1588.007Sub-technique of:T1588ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:11 March 2024Last Modified:15 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.ReferencesMicrosoft Threat Intelligence.
