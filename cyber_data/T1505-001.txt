SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries. Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).Adversaries may craft malicious stored procedures that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.[1][2]To execute operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable additional functionality, such as xp_cmdshell for MSSQL Server.[1][2][3]Microsoft SQL Server can enable common language runtime (CLR) integration. With CLR integration enabled, application developers can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g. VB .NET, C#, etc.).[4]Adversaries may craft or modify CLR assemblies that are linked to stored procedures since these CLR assemblies can be made to execute arbitrary commands.[5]ID:T1505.001Sub-technique of:T1505ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEM, rootContributors:Carlos Borges, @huntingneo, CIP; Kaspersky; Lucas da Silva Pereira, @vulcanunsec, CIPVersion:1.0Created:12 December 2019Last Modified:25 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused various MS-SQL stored procedures.[6]S0603StuxnetStuxnetused xp_cmdshell to store and execute SQL code.[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditRegularly check component software on critical services that adversaries may target for persistence to verify the integrity of the systems and identify if unexpected changes have been made.M1045Code SigningEnsure all application component binaries are signed by the correct application developers.M1026Privileged Account ManagementDo not allow administrator accounts that have permissions to add component software on these services to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems.
