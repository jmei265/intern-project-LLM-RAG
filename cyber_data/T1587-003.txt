SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex:Asymmetric CryptographywithWeb Protocols) or even enablingAdversary-in-the-Middleif added to the root of trust (i.e.Install Root Certificate).After creating a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (seeInstall Digital Certificate) on infrastructure under their control.ID:T1587.003Sub-technique of:T1587ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:16 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has created self-signed digital certificates to enable mutual TLS authentication for malware.[1][2]C0011C0011ForC0011,Transparent Tribeestablished SSL certificates on the typo-squatted domains the group registered.[3]G0056PROMETHIUMPROMETHIUMhas created self-signed digital certificates for use in HTTPS C2 traffic.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentConsider use of services that may aid in the tracking of certificates in use on sites across the Internet.
