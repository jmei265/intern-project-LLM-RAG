These services, such asVNC,Team Viewer,AnyDesk,ScreenConnect,LogMein,AmmyyAdmin, and other remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.[1][2][3]Remote access software may be installed and used post-compromise as an alternate communications channel for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system. They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary-controlled system.Adversaries may similarly abuse response features included in EDR and other defensive tools that enable remote access.Installation of many remote access software may also include persistence (e.g., the software's installation routine creates aWindows Service). Remote access modules/features may also exist as part of otherwise existing software (e.g., Google Chrome’s Remote Desktop).[4][5]ID:T1219Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Dray Agha, @Purp1eW0lf, Huntress Labs; Matt Kelly, @breakersall; Zachary Stanford, @svch0stVersion:2.3Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:12 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1024AkiraAkirauses legitimate utilities such as AnyDesk and PuTTy for maintaining remote access to victim environments.[6][7]C0015C0015DuringC0015, the threat actors installed the AnyDesk remote desktop application onto the compromised network.[8]C0018C0018DuringC0018, the threat actors used AnyDesk to transfer tools between systems.[9][10]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spiderdirected victims to run remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools.[11]S0030CarbanakCarbanakhas a plugin for VNC and Ammyy Admin Tool.[12]G0008CarbanakCarbanakused legitimate programs such as AmmyyAdmin and Team Viewer for remote interactive C2 to target systems.[13]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Groupused the Ammyy Admin tool as well as TeamViewer for remote access, including to preserve remote access if a Cobalt Strike module was lost.[14][15][16]G0105DarkVishnyaDarkVishnyaused DameWare Mini Remote Control for lateral movement.[17]S0384DridexDridexcontains a module for VNC.[18]S0554EgregorEgregorhas checked for the LogMein event log in an attempt to encrypt files in remote machines.[19]G0120EvilnumEVILNUMhas used the malware variant, TerraTV, to run a legitimate TeamViewer application to connect to compromrised machines.[20]G0046FIN7FIN7has utilized the remote management tool Atera to download malware to a compromised system.[21]G0115GOLD SOUTHFIELDGOLD SOUTHFIELDhas used the cloud-based remote management and monitoring tool "ConnectWise Control" to deployREvil.[22]S0601HildegardHildegardhas established tmate sessions for C2 communications.[23]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used a modified TeamViewer client as a command and control channel.[24][25]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas used legitimate applications ScreenConnect and AteraAgent to manage systems remotely and move laterally.[26][27][28]G0129Mustang PandaMustang Pandahas installed TeamViewer on targeted systems.[29]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors used several remote administration tools as persistent infiltration channels.[30]S0148RTMRTMhas the capability to download a VNC module from command and control (C2).[31]G0048RTMRTMhas used a modified version of TeamViewer and Remote Utilities for remote access.[32]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas used remote administration tools or remote industrial control system client software for execution and to maliciously release electricity breakers.[33][34]G1015Scattered SpiderDuringC0027,Scattered Spiderdirected victims to run remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools.[11]In addition to directing victims to run remote software, Scattered Spider members themselves also deploy RMM software including AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and ConnectWise Control to establish persistence on the compromised network.[35][36]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas established tmate sessions for C2 communications.[23][37]G0076ThripThripused a cloud-based remote access software called LogMeIn for their attacks.[38]S0266TrickBotTrickBotuses vncDll module to remote control the victim machine.[39][40]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider disabling unnecessary remote connection functionality, including both unapproved software installations and specific features built into supported applications.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control to mitigate installation and use of unapproved software that can be used for remote access.M1037Filter Network TrafficProperly configure firewalls, application firewalls, and proxies to limit outgoing traffic to sites and services used by remote access software.M1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures may be able to prevent traffic to remote access services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.Network Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for applications and processes related to remote admin software. Correlate activity with other suspicious behavior that may reduce false positives if this type of software is used by legitimate users and administrators.Domain Frontingmay be used in conjunction to avoid defenses. Adversaries will likely need to deploy and/or install these remote software to compromised systems. It may be possible to detect or prevent the installation of this type of software with host-based solutions.ReferencesWueest, C., Anand, H. (2017, July).
