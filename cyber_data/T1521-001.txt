Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and RC4.ID:T1521.001Sub-technique of:T1521Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.0Created:05 April 2022Last Modified:05 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto encrypt C2 communication using AES.[1]S0478EventBotEventBothas encrypted base64-encoded payload data using RC4 and Curve25519.[2]S0411RotexyRotexyencrypts JSON HTTP payloads with AES.[3]S1055SharkBotSharkBotcan use RC4 to encrypt C2 payloads.[4]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas encrypted C2 communications using AES in CBC mode during Operation BULL and Operation ROCK.[5]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
