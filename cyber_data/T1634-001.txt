Keychains are the built-in way for iOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, private keys, and VPN credentials.On the device, the keychain database is stored outside of application sandboxes to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data. Standard iOS APIs allow applications access to their own keychain contained within the database. By utilizing a privilege escalation exploit or existing root access, adversaries can access the entire encrypted database.[1][2]ID:T1634.001Sub-technique of:T1634Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:iOSⓘMTC ID:AUT-11Version:1.1Created:01 April 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0463INSOMNIAINSOMNIAcan extract the device’s keychain.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation can often detect jailbroken devices.M1010Deploy Compromised Device Detection MethodMobile security products can take appropriate action when jailbroken devices are detected, potentially limiting the adversary’s access to password stores.M1001Security UpdatesApple regularly provides security updates for known OS vulnerabilities.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services may be able to detect known privilege escalation exploits contained within applications, as well as searching application packages for strings that correlate to known password store locations.DS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusMobile security products can potentially detect jailbroken devices.ReferencesApple, Inc..
