The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.Example commands to find Registry keys related to password information:[1]Local Machine Hive:reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /sCurrent User Hive:reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /sID:T1552.002Sub-technique of:T1552ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSystem Requirements:Ability to query some Registry locations depends on the adversary's level of access. User permissions are usually limited to access of user-related Registry keys.Contributors:Sudhanshu Chauhan, @Sudhanshu_CVersion:1.1Created:04 February 2020Last Modified:28 July 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas the ability to extract credentials from the Registry.[2]G0050APT32APT32used Outlook Credential Dumper to harvest credentials stored in Windows registry.[3][4]S1022IceAppleIceApplecan harvest credentials from local and remote host registries.[5]S0194PowerSploitPowerSploithas several modules that search the Windows Registry for stored credentials:Get-UnattendedInstallFile,Get-Webconfig,Get-ApplicationHost,Get-SiteListPassword,Get-CachedGPPPassword, andGet-RegistryAutoLogon.[1]S0075RegRegmay be used to find credentials in the Windows Registry.[1]S0266TrickBotTrickBothas retrieved PuTTY credentials by querying theSoftware\SimonTatham\Putty\Sessionsregistry key[6]S0476ValakValakcan use the clientgrabber module to steal e-mail credentials from the Registry.[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditProactively search for credentials within the Registry and attempt to remediate the risk.M1027Password PoliciesDo not store credentials within the Registry.M1026Privileged Account ManagementIf it is necessary that software must store credentials in the Registry, then ensure the associated accounts have limited permissions so they cannot be abused if obtained by an adversary.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes for applications that can be used to query the Registry, such asReg, and collect command parameters that may indicate credentials are being searched. Correlate activity with related suspicious behavior that may indicate an active intrusion to reduce false positives.Note: Pseudocode Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for command-line instances of searching the Windows Registry for insecurely stored credentials. This can be accomplished using the query functionality of theRegsystem utility, by looking for keys and values that contain strings such as "password". In addition, adversaries may use toolkits such asPowerSploitin order to dump credentials from various applications such as IIS. Accordingly, this analytic looks for invocations of reg.exe in this capacity as well as that of several PowerSploit modules with similar functionality.Analytic 1 - Credentials in Files & Registry(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688")CommandLine="regquery HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s" ORCommandLine="regquery HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s" ORCommandLine="Get-UnattendedInstallFile" ORCommandLine="Get-Webconfig" ORCommandLine="Get-ApplicationHost" ORCommandLine="Get-SiteListPassword" ORCommandLine="Get-CachedGPPPassword" ORCommandLine="Get-RegistryAutoLogon*"DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key AccessMonitor for unexpected windows registry key being accessed that may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.ReferencesnetbiosX.
