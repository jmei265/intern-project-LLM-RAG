Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. Adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a signed program, then use it as a template for an unsigned program. Files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks, but they may appear more legitimate to users and security tools may improperly handle these files.[1]UnlikeCode Signing, this activity will not result in a valid signature.ID:T1036.001Sub-technique of:T1036ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:10 February 2020Last Modified:10 February 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0067APT37APT37has signed its malware with an invalid digital certificates listed as "Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited."[2]S0128BADNEWSBADNEWSis sometimes signed with an invalid Authenticode certificate in an apparent effort to make it look more legitimate.[3]S0666GelsemiumGelsemiumhas used unverified signatures on malicious DLLs.[4]S0198NETWIRETheNETWIREclient has been signed by fake and invalid digital certificates.[5]S1050PcSharePcSharehas used an invalid certificate in attempt to appear legitimate.[6]S0019ReginReginstage 1 modules for 64-bit systems have been found to be signed with fake certificates masquerading as originating from Microsoft Corporation and Broadcom Corporation.[7]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas used revoked certificates to sign malware.[8][9]S0466WindTailWindTailhas been incompletely signed with revoked certificates.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1045Code SigningRequire signed binaries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile MetadataCollect and analyze signing certificate metadata and check signature validity on software that executes within the environment, look for invalid signatures as well as unusual certificate characteristics and outliers.ReferencesVest, J.
