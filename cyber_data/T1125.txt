Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs fromScreen Capturedue to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton.[1]ID:T1125Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:PraetorianVersion:1.1Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslacan access the victim’s webcam and record video.[2][3]S1087AsyncRATAsyncRATcan record screen content on targeted systems.[4]S0234BandookBandookhas modules that are capable of capturing video from a victim's webcam.[5]S0660ClamblingClamblingcan record screen content in AVI format.[6][7]S0338Cobian RATCobian RAThas a feature to access the webcam on the victim’s machine.[8]S0591ConnectWiseConnectWisecan record video on remote hosts.[9]S0115CrimsonCrimsoncan capture webcam video on targeted systems.[10][11]S0334DarkCometDarkCometcan access the victim’s webcam to take pictures.[12][13]S0021DerusbiDerusbiis capable of capturing video.[14]S0363EmpireEmpirecan capture webcam data on Windows and macOS systems.[15]S0152EvilGrabEvilGrabhas the capability to capture video from a victim machine.[16]G0046FIN7FIN7created a custom video recording capability that could be used to monitor operations in the victim's environment.[17][18]S0434Imminent MonitorImminent Monitorhas a remote webcam monitoring capability.[19][20]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan remotely activate the victim’s webcam to capture content.[21][22]S0283jRATjRAThas the capability to capture video from a webcam.[23][24]S0265KazuarKazuarcaptures images from the webcam.[25]S0409MacheteMachetetakes photos from the computer’s web camera.[26][27][28]S0336NanoCoreNanoCorecan access the victim's webcam and capture data.[29][30]S0385njRATnjRATcan access the victim's webcam.[31][32]S0644ObliqueRATObliqueRATcan capture images from webcams on compromised hosts.[33]S1050PcSharePcSharecan capture camera video as part of its collection process.[34]S0428PoetRATPoetRAThas used a Python tool named Bewmac to record the webcam on compromised hosts.[35]S0192PupyPupycan access a connected webcam and capture pictures.[36]S0262QuasarRATQuasarRATcan perform webcam viewing.[37][38]S0332RemcosRemcoscan access a system’s webcam and take pictures.[39]S0379Revenge RATRevenge RAThas the ability to access the webcam.[40][41]S0461SDBbotSDBbothas the ability to record video on a compromised host.[42][43]G0091SilenceSilencehas been observed making videos of victims to observe bank employees day to day activities.[44][45]S0098T9000T9000uses the Skype API to record audio and video calls.

Telemetry data regarding API use may not be useful depending on how a system is normally used, but may provide context to other potentially malicious activity occurring on a system. Behavior that could indicate technique use include an unknown or unusual process accessing APIs associated with devices or software that interact with the video camera, recording devices, or recording software, and a process periodically writing files to disk that contain video or camera image data.ReferencesPatrick Wardle.
