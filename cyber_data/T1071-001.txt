Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.Protocols such as HTTP/S[1]and WebSocket[2]that carry web traffic may be very common in environments. HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic.ID:T1071.001Sub-technique of:T1071ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:TruKnoVersion:1.3Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm TeamusedBlackEnergyto communicate between compromised hosts and their command-and-control servers via HTTP post requests.[3]S00663PARA RAT3PARA RATuses HTTP for command and control.[1]S00654H RAT4H RATuses HTTP for command and control.[1]S0469ABKABKhas the ability to use HTTP in communications with C2.[4]S1028Action RATAction RATcan use HTTP to communicate with C2 servers.[5]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLconnects to port 80 of a C2 server using Wininet API.
