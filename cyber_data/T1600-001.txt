As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in aNetwork Device CLIintroduced to the system throughModify System Imageto change the configuration of the device.[2]ID:T1600.001Sub-technique of:T1600ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Detection efforts may be focused on closely related adversary behaviors, such as Modify System Image and Network Device CLI. Some detection methods require vendor support to aid in investigation.ReferencesGraham Holmes. (2015, October 8). Evolution of attacks on Cisco IOS devices. Retrieved October 19, 2020.Omar Santos.
