Employee names be used to derive email addresses as well as to help guide other reconnaissance efforts and/or craft more-believable lures.Adversaries may easily gather employee names, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites).[1]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorPhishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex:Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:PhishingorValid Accounts).ID:T1589.003Sub-technique of:T1589ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41To support initial access,APT41gained access to databases with information about existing accounts and lists of employees.[2]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas collected victim employee name information.[3]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Team's research of potential victim organizations included the identification and collection of employee information.[4]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas collected lists of names for individuals from targeted organizations.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesCybersecurity Resource Center.
