By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.Once compromised, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or toProxytraffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.[1][2]As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary traffic to these providers.[3][1]ID:T1584.007Sub-technique of:T1584ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Awake SecurityVersion:1.0Created:08 July 2022Last Modified:20 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries leverage serverless functions as infrastructure (ex: for command and control), it may be possible to look for unique characteristics associated with adversary software, if known.[4]Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle.ReferencesLawrence Abrams. (2020, March 14). BlackWater Malware Abuses Cloudflare Workers for C2 Communication.
