DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC.[1]Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash.[2]This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors).[1]The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to performSID-History Injectionand/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.[1]ID:T1207Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorⓘDefense Bypassed:Log analysisContributors:Vincent Le TouxVersion:2.1Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:08 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0002MimikatzMimikatz’sLSADUMP::DCShadowmodule can be used to make AD updates by temporarily setting a computer to be a DC.[3][2]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

The SPN associated with the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol interface (GUID E3514235–4B06–11D1-AB04–00C04FC2DCD2) can be set without logging.[5]A rogue DC must authenticate as a service using these two SPNs for the replication process to successfully complete.ReferencesDelpy, B. & LE TOUX, V.
