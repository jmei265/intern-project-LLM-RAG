To wipe disk content, adversaries may acquire direct access to the hard drive in order to overwrite arbitrarily sized portions of disk with random data.[2]Adversaries have also been observed leveraging third-party drivers likeRawDiskto directly access disk content.[1][2]This behavior is distinct fromData Destructionbecause sections of the disk are erased instead of individual files.To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware used for wiping disk content may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques likeValid Accounts,OS Credential Dumping, andSMB/Windows Admin Shares.[2]ID:T1561.001Sub-technique of:T1561ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityVersion:1.1Created:20 February 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1125AcidRainAcidRainiterates over device file identifiers on the target, opens the device file, and either overwrites the file or calls various IOCTLS commands to erase it.[4]S1068BlackCatBlackCathas the ability to wipe VM snapshots on compromised networks.[5][6]S0697HermeticWiperHermeticWiperhas the ability to corrupt disk partitions and obtain raw disk access to destroy data.[7][8]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas used malware like WhiskeyAlfa to overwrite the first 64MB of every drive with a mix of static and random buffers. A similar process is then used to wipe content in logical drives and, finally, attempt to wipe every byte of every sector on every drive. WhiskeyBravo can be used to overwrite the first 4.9MB of physical drives. WhiskeyDelta can overwrite the first 132MB or 1.5MB of each drive with random data from heap memory.[2]S0576MegaCortexMegaCortexcan wipe deleted data from all drives usingcipher.exe.[9]S0364RawDiskRawDiskhas been used to directly access the hard disk to help overwrite arbitrarily sized portions of disk content.[2]S0380StoneDrillStoneDrillcan wipe the accessible physical or logical drives of the infected machine.[10]S0689WhisperGateWhisperGatecan overwrite sectors of a victim host's hard drive at periodic offsets.[11][12][13]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1053Data BackupConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.[14]Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups to prevent recovery.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.DS0016DriveDrive AccessMonitor for newly constructed drive letters or mount points to a data storage device for attempts to write to sensitive locations like the partition boot sector, master boot record, disk partition table, or BIOS parameter block/superblock.Drive ModificationMonitor for changes made to drive letters or mount points of data storage devices for attempts to read to sensitive locations like the partition boot sector, master boot record, disk partition table, or BIOS parameter block/superblock.DS0027DriverDriver LoadMonitor for unusual kernel driver installation activity may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.ReferencesNovetta Threat Research Group.
