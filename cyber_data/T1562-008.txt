Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities.For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity.[1]They may alternatively tamper with logging functionality – for example, by removing any associated SNS topics, disabling multi-region logging, or disabling settings that validate and/or encrypt log files.[2][3]In Office 365, an adversary may disable logging on mail collection activities for specific users by using theSet-MailboxAuditBypassAssociationcmdlet, by disabling M365 Advanced Auditing for the user, or by downgrading the user’s license from an Enterprise E5 to an Enterprise E3 license.[4]ID:T1562.008Sub-technique of:T1562ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:Alex Soler, AttackIQ; Ibrahim Ali Khan; Janantha Marasinghe; Joe Gumke, U.S. Bank; Matt Snyder, VMware; Prasad Somasamudram, McAfee; Sekhar Sarukkai, McAfee; Syed Ummar Farooqh, McAfeeVersion:2.0Created:12 October 2020Last Modified:12 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has disabled Purview Audit on targeted accounts prior to stealing emails from  Microsoft 365 tenants.[5]S1091PacuPacucan disable or otherwise restrict various AWS logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and VPC flow logs.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementConfigure default account policy to enable logging.
