Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. Third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after booting Windows in safe mode. There are two versions of safe mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode with Networking. It is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.[1][2]Adversaries may abuse safe mode to disable endpoint defenses that may not start with a limited boot. Hosts can be forced into safe mode after the next reboot via modifications to Boot Configuration Data (BCD) stores, which are files that manage boot application settings.[3]Adversaries may also add their malicious applications to the list of minimal services that start in safe mode by modifying relevant Registry values (i.e.Modify Registry). MaliciousComponent Object Model(COM) objects may also be registered and loaded in safe mode.[2][4][5][6]ID:T1562.009Sub-technique of:T1562ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Host Intrusion Prevention SystemsContributors:Jorell Magtibay, National Australia Bank Limited; Kiyohito Yamamoto, RedLark, NTT Communications; Yusuke Kubo, RedLark, NTT CommunicationsVersion:1.0Created:23 June 2021Last Modified:31 August 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1053AvosLockerAvosLockercan restart a compromised machine in safe mode.[7][8]S1070Black BastaBlack Bastacan reboot victim machines in safe mode with networking viabcdedit /set safeboot network.[9][10][11][12][13]S0496REvilREvilcan force a reboot in safe mode with networking.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementRestrict administrator accounts to as few individuals as possible, following least privilege principles, that may be abused to remotely boot a machine in safe mode.[4]M1054Software ConfigurationEnsure that endpoint defenses run in safe mode.[4]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments associated with making configuration changes to boot settings, such asbcdedit.exeandbootcfg.exe.[3][14][2]DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key CreationMonitor Registry creation for services that may start on safe mode. For example, a program can be forced to start on safe mode boot by adding a*in front of the "Startup" value name:HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run["*Startup"="{Path}"]or by adding a key toHKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal.[6][2]Windows Registry Key ModificationMonitor modifications to Registry data associated with enabling safe mode.
