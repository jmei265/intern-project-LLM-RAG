in compression or encrypting data that is collected prior to exfiltration, such as tar.DS0022FileFile CreationMonitor newly constructed files being written with extensions and/or headers associated with compressed or encrypted file types. Detection efforts may focus on follow-on exfiltration activity, where compressed or encrypted files can be detected in transit with a network intrusion detection or data loss prevention system analyzing file headers.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that aid in compression or encrypting data that is collected prior to exfiltration, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip. BeforeExfiltrationthat an adversary hasCollection, it is very likely that aArchive Collected Datawill be created, so that transfer times are minimized and fewer files are transmitted. There is variety between the tools used to compress data, but the command line usage and context of archiving tools, such as ZIP, RAR, and 7ZIP, should be monitored.In addition to looking for RAR or 7z program names, command line usage of 7Zip or RAR can be detected with the flag usage of "* a *". This is helpful, as adversaries may change program names.Note: This analytic looks for the command line argument a, which is used by RAR. However, there may be other programs that have this as a legitimate argument and may need to be filtered out.Analytic 1 - Command Line Usage of Archiving Software(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") CommandLine="a"ReferencesLiving Off The Land Binaries, Scripts and Libraries (LOLBAS).
