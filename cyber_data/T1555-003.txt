Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file,AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Dataand executing a SQL query:SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;. The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API functionCryptUnprotectData, which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.[2]Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc.[3][4]Windows stores Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge credentials in Credential Lockers managed by theWindows Credential Manager.Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.[5]After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access. This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).ID:T1555.003Sub-technique of:T1555ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:Barry Shteiman, Exabeam; RedHuntLabs, @redhuntlabs; Ryan Benson, Exabeam; Sylvain Gil, ExabeamVersion:1.1Created:12 February 2020Last Modified:15 February 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslacan gather credentials from a number of browsers.[6]G0130Ajax Security TeamAjax Security Teamhas used FireMalv custom-developed malware, which collected passwords from the Firefox browser storage.[7]G0022APT3APT3has used tools to dump passwords from browsers.[8]G0064APT33APT33has used a variety of publicly available tools likeLaZagneto gather credentials.[9][10]G0067APT37APT37has used a credential stealer known as ZUMKONG that can harvest usernames and passwords stored in browsers.[11]G0096APT41APT41used BrowserGhost, a tool designed to obtain credentials from browsers, to retrieve information from password stores.[12]S0344AzorultAzorultcan steal credentials from the victim's browser.[13]S0093Backdoor.OldreaSomeBackdoor.Oldreasamples contain a publicly available Web browser password recovery tool.[14]S0089BlackEnergyBlackEnergyhas used a plug-in to gather credentials from web browsers including FireFox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer.[15][16]S0657BLUELIGHTBLUELIGHTcan collect passwords stored in web browers, including Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, and Naver Whale.[17]S0484CarberpCarberp's passw.plug plugin can gather passwords saved in Opera, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.[18]S0631ChaesChaescan steal login credentials and stored financial information from the browser.[19]S0144ChChesChChessteals credentials stored inside Internet Explorer.[20]S0492CookieMinerCookieMinercan steal saved usernames and passwords in Chrome as well as credit card credentials.[21]S0050CosmicDukeCosmicDukecollects user credentials, including passwords, for various programs including Web browsers.[22]S0115CrimsonCrimsoncontains a module to steal credentials from Web browsers on the victim machine.[23][24]S0367EmotetEmotethas been observed dropping browser password grabber modules.[25][26]S0363EmpireEmpirecan use modules that extract passwords from common web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome.[27]G0037FIN6FIN6has used the Stealer One credential stealer to target web browsers.[28]S0531GrandoreiroGrandoreirocan steal cookie data and credentials from Google Chrome.[29][30]S0132H1N1H1N1dumps usernames and passwords from Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Outlook.[31]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used aMimikatz-based tool and a PowerShell script to steal passwords from Google Chrome.[32]S0434Imminent MonitorImminent Monitorhas a PasswordRecoveryPacket module for recovering browser passwords.[33]G0100InceptionInceptionused a browser plugin to steal passwords and sessions from Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Torch, and Yandex.[34]S0528JavaliJavalican capture login credentials from open browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Edge.[35]S0283jRATjRATcan capture passwords from common web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Firefox.[36]S0387KeyBoyKeyBoyattempts to collect passwords from browsers.[37]S0526KGH_SPYKGH_SPYhas the ability to steal data from the Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Thunderbird, and Opera browsers.[38]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used browser extensions including Google Chrome to steal passwords and cookies from browsers.Kimsukyhas also used Nirsoft's WebBrowserPassView tool to dump the passwords obtained from victims.[39][40][41][42]S0356KONNIKONNIcan steal profiles (containing credential information) from Firefox, Chrome, and Opera.[43]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has obtained passwords and session tokens with the use of the Redline password stealer.[44]S0349LaZagneLaZagnecan obtain credentials from web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox.[45]G0077LeafminerLeafminerused several tools for retrieving login and password information, including LaZagne.[46]S0681LizarLizarhas a module to collect usernames and passwords stored in browsers.[47]S0447LokibotLokibothas demonstrated the ability to steal credentials from multiple applications and data sources including Safari and the Chromium and Mozilla Firefox-based web browsers.[48]S0409MacheteMachetecollects stored credentials from several web browsers.[49]G1026MalteiroMalteirohas stolen credentials stored in the victim’s browsers via software tool NirSoft WebBrowserPassView.[50]S0530MelcozMelcozhas the ability to steal credentials from web browsers.[35]S0002MimikatzMimikatzperforms credential dumping to obtain account and password information useful in gaining access to additional systems and enterprise network resources.
