Thetrapcommand allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts likectrl+candctrl+d.Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following formattrap 'command list' signalswhere "command list" will be executed when "signals" are received.[1][2]ID:T1546.005Sub-technique of:T1546ⓘTactics:Privilege Escalation,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserVersion:1.0Created:24 January 2020Last Modified:24 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
