JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.[1]JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the same scripting standard. JScript is interpreted via the Windows Script engine and thus integrated with many components of Windows such as theComponent Object Modeland Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages.[2][3][4]JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA), that was introduced in OSX 10.10. Apple’s OSA provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs. As of OSX 10.10, OSA only supports two languages, JXA andAppleScript. Scripts can be executed via the command line utilityosascript, they can be compiled into applications or script files viaosacompile, and they can be compiled and executed in memory of other programs by leveraging the OSAKit Framework.[5][6][7][8][9]Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript to execute various behaviors. Common uses include hosting malicious scripts on websites as part of aDrive-by Compromiseor downloading and executing these script files as secondary payloads. Since these payloads are text-based, it is also very common for adversaries to obfuscate their content as part ofObfuscated Files or Information.ID:T1059.007Sub-technique

malicious downloaded content[75].M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramTurn off or restrict access to unneeded scripting components.M1038Execution PreventionDenylist scripting where appropriate.M1021Restrict Web-Based ContentScript blocking extensions can help prevent the execution of JavaScript and HTA files that may commonly be used during the exploitation process. For malicious code served up through ads, adblockers can help prevent that code from executing in the first place.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionScripting execution is likely to perform actions with various effects on a system that may generate events, depending on the types of monitoring used. Monitor processes and command-line arguments for execution and subsequent behavior. Actions may be related to network and system informationDiscovery,Collection, or other programmable post-compromise behaviors and could be used as indicators of detection leading back to the source. Monitor for execution of JXA throughosascriptand usage ofOSAScriptAPI that may be related to other suspicious behavior occurring on the system.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor for the loading of modules associated with scripting languages (ex: JScript.dll).DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for events associated with scripting execution, such as process activity, usage of the Windows Script Host (typically cscript.exe or wscript.exe), file activity involving scriptsDS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.ReferencesOpenJS Foundation. (n.d.). Node.js. Retrieved June 23, 2020.Microsoft. (2018, May 31).
