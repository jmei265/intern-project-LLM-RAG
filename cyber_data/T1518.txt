Adversaries may use the information fromSoftware Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Such software may be deployed widely across the environment for configuration management or security reasons, such asSoftware Deployment Tools, and may allow adversaries broad access to infect devices or move laterally.Adversaries may attempt to enumerate software for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out what security measures are present or if the compromised system has a version of software that is vulnerable toExploitation for Privilege Escalation.ID:T1518Sub-techniques:T1518.001ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.4Created:16 September 2019Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0534BazarBazarcan query the Registry for installed applications.[1]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas used tools to enumerate software installed on an infected host.[2]S0482BundloreBundlorehas the ability to enumerate what browser is being used as well as version information for Safari.[3]S0674CharmPowerCharmPowercan list the installed applications on a compromised host.[4]S0154Cobalt StrikeTheCobalt StrikeSystem Profiler can discover applications through the browser and identify the version of Java the target has.[5]S0126ComRATComRATcan check the victim's default browser to determine which process to inject its communications module into.[6]S0472down_newdown_newhas the ability to gather information on installed applications.[2]S0384DridexDridexhas collected a list of installed software on the system.[7]S0062DustySkyDustySkylists all installed software for the infected machine.[8]S0024DyreDyrehas the ability to identify installed programs on a compromised host.[9]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas enumerated programs installed on an infected machine.[10]S0431HotCroissantHotCroissantcan retrieve a list of applications from theSOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Pathsregistry key.[11]G0100InceptionInceptionhas enumerated installed software on compromised systems.[12]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan collect information about installed software used by specific users, software executed on user login, and software executed by each system.[13][14]S0526KGH_SPYKGH_SPYcan collect information on installed applications.[15]S0652MarkiRATMarkiRATcan check for the Telegram installation directory by enumerating the files on disk.[16]S0455MetamorfoMetamorfohas searched the compromised system for banking applications.[17][18]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas used a PowerShell backdoor to check for Skype connectivity on the target machine.[19]G0129Mustang PandaMustang Pandahas searched the victim system for theInstallUtil.exeprogram and its version.[20]C0016Operation Dust StormDuringOperation Dust Storm, the threat actors deployed a file calledDeployJava.jsto fingerprint installed software on a victim system prior to exploit delivery.[21]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors collected a list of installed software on the infected system.[22]S0229OrzOrzcan gather the victim's Internet Explorer version.[23]S0598P.A.S.
