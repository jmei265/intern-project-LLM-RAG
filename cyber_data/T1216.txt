Several Microsoft signed scripts that have been downloaded from Microsoft or are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files.[1]This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application control and signature validation on systems.[2]ID:T1216Sub-techniques:T1216.001,T1216.002ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Praetorian; Wes HurdVersion:2.0Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:18 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionCertain signed scripts that can be used to execute other programs may not be necessary within a given environment.

If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.ReferencesOddvar Moe et al. (2022, February).  Living Off The Land Binaries, Scripts and Libraries.
