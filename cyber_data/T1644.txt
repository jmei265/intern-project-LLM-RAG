This could be done for a variety of reasons, including evading network traffic monitoring, as a backup method of command and control, or for data exfiltration if the device is not connected to any Internet-providing networks (i.e. cellular or Wi-Fi). Several out of band data streams exist, such as SMS messages, NFC, and Bluetooth.On Android, applications can read push notifications to capture content from SMS messages, or other out of band data streams. This requires that the user manually grant notification access to the application via the settings menu. However, the application could launch an Intent to take the user directly there.On iOS, there is no way to programmatically read push notifications.ID:T1644Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:2.1Created:06 April 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0304Android/Chuli.AAndroid/Chuli.Aused SMS to receive command and control messages.[1]S1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYcan use SMS to send C2 commands.[2]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan perform actions when one of two hardcoded magic SMS strings is received.[3]S0529CarbonStealCarbonStealhas used specially crafted SMS messages to control the target device.[4]S0505Desert ScorpionDesert Scorpioncan be controlled using SMS messages.[5]S0406GustuffGustuffcan use SMS for command and control from a defined admin phone number.[6]S0407MonokleMonoklecan be controlled via email and SMS from a set of "control phones."[7]S0316Pegasus for AndroidPegasus for Androiduses SMS for command and control.[8]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOSuses SMS for command and control.[9]S0295RCSAndroidRCSAndroidcan use SMS for command and control.[10]S0411RotexyRotexycan be controlled through SMS messages.[11]S1055SharkBotSharkBotcan use the "Direct Reply" feature of Android to automatically reply to notifications with a message provided by C2.[12]S0327SkygofreeSkygofreecan be controlled via binary SMS.[13]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealerenables remote control of the victim through SMS channels.[14]S0328Stealth MangoStealth Mangouses commands received from text messages for C2.[15]S0427TrickMoTrickMocan be controlled via encrypted SMS message.[16]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1011User GuidanceUsers should be instructed to not grant applications unexpected or unnecessary permissions.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0042User InterfaceSystem NotificationsIf the user sees a notification with text they do not recognize, they should review their list of installed applications.ReferencesCostin Raiu, Denis Maslennikov, Kurt Baumgartner.
