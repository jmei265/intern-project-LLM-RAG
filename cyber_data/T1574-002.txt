Similar toDLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.[1]ID:T1574.002Sub-technique of:T1574ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application ControlVersion:2.0Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0073APT19APT19launched an HTTP malware variant and a Port 22 malware variant using a legitimate executable that loaded the malicious DLL.[2]G0022APT3APT3has been known to side load DLLs with a valid version of Chrome with one of their tools.[3][4]G0050APT32APT32ran legitimately-signed executables from Symantec and McAfee which load a malicious DLL.
