Additionally, where possible, developers should lock software dependencies to specific versions rather than pulling the latest version on build.[8]M1046Boot IntegrityUse secure methods to boot a system and verify the integrity of the operating system and loading mechanisms.M1033Limit Software InstallationWhere possible, consider requiring developers to pull from internal repositories containing verified and approved packages rather than from external ones.[8]M1051Update SoftwareA patch management process should be implemented to check unused dependencies, unmaintained and/or previously vulnerable dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation.M1016Vulnerability ScanningContinuous monitoring of vulnerability sources and the use of automatic and manual code review tools should also be implemented as well.[9]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile MetadataUse verification of distributed binaries through hash checking or other integrity checking mechanisms. Scan downloads for malicious signatures and attempt to test software and updates prior to deployment while taking note of potential suspicious activity.DS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusPerform physical inspection of hardware to look for potential tampering. Perform integrity checking on pre-OS boot mechanisms that can be manipulated for malicious purposes and compare against known good baseline behavior.ReferencesIBM Support. (2017, April 26).
