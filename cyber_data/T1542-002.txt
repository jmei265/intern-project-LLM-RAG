Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar toSystem Firmwarebut conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.Malicious component firmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks.ID:T1542.002Sub-technique of:T1542ⓘTactics:Persistence,Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Ability to update component device firmware from the host operating system.ⓘPermissions Required:SYSTEMⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, File monitoring, Host intrusion prevention systemsVersion:1.1Created:19 December 2019Last Modified:01 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0687Cyclops BlinkCyclops Blinkhas maintained persistence by patching legitimate device firmware when it is downloaded, including that of WatchGuard devices.[1]G0020EquationEquationis known to have the capability to overwrite the firmware on hard drives from some manufacturers.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1051Update SoftwarePerform regular firmware updates to mitigate risks of exploitation and/or abuse.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0027DriverDriver MetadataMonitor for unexpected disk partition table entries, or blocks of otherwise unusual memory that warrant deeper investigationDS0001FirmwareFirmware ModificationMonitor for changes that may reveal indicators of malicious firmware such as strings.

Otherwise, this technique may be difficult to detect since malicious activity is taking place on system components possibly outside the purview of OS security and integrity mechanisms.ReferencesNCSC.
