The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). Adversaries may employ custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) or embed data within protocol headers and fields.ID:T1639.001Sub-technique of:T1639Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-30Version:1.1Created:06 April 2022Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan download text files with commands from an FTP server and exfiltrate data via email.[1]S0425Corona UpdatesCorona Updateshas exfiltrated data using FTP.[2]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
