For example, malware operators may limit the distribution of a second stage payload to certain geographic regions.[1]Geofencingis accomplished by persuading the user to grant the application permission to access location services. The application can then collect, process, and exfiltrate the device’s location to perform location-based actions, such as ceasing malicious behavior or showing region-specific advertisements.One method to accomplishGeofencingon Android is to use the built-in Geofencing API to automatically trigger certain behaviors when the device enters or exits a specified radius around a geographical location. Similar to  otherGeofencingmethods, this requires that the user has granted theACCESS_FINE_LOCATIONandACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATIONpermissions. The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher. However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime. These additional controls include "Allow only while using the app", which will effectively prohibit background location collection.Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing. Depending on the use case, the app will either need to callrequestWhenInUseAuthorization()orrequestAlwaysAuthorization(), depending on when access to the location services is required. Similar to Android, users also have the option to limit when the application can access the device’s location, including one-time use and only when the application is running in the foreground.Geofencingcan be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. For example, location data could be used to limit malware spread and/or capabilities, which could also potentially evade application analysis environments (ex: malware analysis outside of the target geographic area). Other malicious usages could include showing language-specific input prompts and/or advertisements.ID:T1627.001Sub-technique of:T1627Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1094BRATABRATAhas performed country and language checks.[2]S0507eSurveSurvimposes geo-restrictions when delivering the second stage.[1]G0112WindshiftWindshifthas region-locked their malicious applications during their Operation BULL campaign.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionNew OS releases frequently contain additional limitations or controls around device location access.M1011User GuidanceUsers should be advised to be extra scrutinous of applications that request location, and to deny any permissions requests for applications they do not recognize.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services can detect unnecessary and potentially abused API calls.Permissions RequestsApplication vetting services can detect unnecessary and potentially abused location permissions.DS0042User InterfaceSystem NotificationsOn Android 10 and later, the system shows a notification to the user when an app has been accessing device location in the background.System SettingsThe user can review which applications have location permissions in the operating system’s settings menu.ReferencesA.
