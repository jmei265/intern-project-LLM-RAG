TheAllowReversiblePasswordEncryptionproperty specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.[1]If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:Encrypted password (G$RADIUSCHAP) from the Active Directory user-structureuserParameters16 byte randomly-generated value (G$RADIUSCHAPKEY) also fromuserParametersGlobal LSA secret (G$MSRADIUSCHAPKEY)Static key hardcoded in the Remote Access Subauthentication DLL (RASSFM.DLL)With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.[2][3]An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectoryPowerShellmodule. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to "Windows Server 2008" or higher.[4]In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar toSet-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true.ID:T1556.005Sub-technique of:T1556ⓘTactics:Credential Access,Defense Evasion,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserVersion:1.0Created:13 January 2022Last Modified:10 February 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1027Password PoliciesEnsure thatAllowReversiblePasswordEncryptionproperty is set to disabled unless there are application requirements.[1]M1026Privileged Account ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account.[5][6]These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.[7]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0026Active DirectoryActive Directory Object ModificationMonitor property changes in Group Policy:Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Store passwords using reversible encryption.
