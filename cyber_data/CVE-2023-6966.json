        "The The Moneytizer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data, modification of data, and loss of data due to a missing capability check on multiple AJAX functions in the /core/core_ajax.php file in all versions up to, and including, 9.5.20. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to update and retrieve billing and bank details, update and reset the plugin's settings, and update languages as well as other lower-severity actions."
