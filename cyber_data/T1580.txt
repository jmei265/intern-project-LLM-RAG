This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services.Cloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure. For example, AWS provides aDescribeInstancesAPI within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, theListBucketsAPI that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, theHeadBucketAPI to determine a bucket’s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or theGetPublicAccessBlockAPI to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket.[1][2][3][4]Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides thegcloud compute instances listcommand to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project[5], and Azure's CLI commandaz vm listlists details of virtual machines.[6]In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure throughWordlist Scanning.[7]An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.[8]The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.[9]An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such asDescribeDBInstancesto determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources.[10]Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike inCloud Service Discovery, this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves.ID:T1580Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaSContributors:Isif Ibrahima, Mandiant; Praetorian; Regina ElwellVersion:1.3Created:20 August 2020Last Modified:20 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1091PacuPacucan enumerate AWS infrastructure, such as EC2 instances.[11]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderenumerates cloud environments to identify server and backup management infrastructure, resource access, databases and storage containers.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementLimit permissions to discover cloud infrastructure in accordance with least privilege. Organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0010Cloud StorageCloud Storage EnumerationMonitor cloud logs for API calls and other potentially unusual activity related to cloud data object storage enumeration.
