Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.[1][2]Authentication certificates can be both stolen and forged. For example, AD CS certificates can be stolen from encrypted storage (in the Registry or files)[3], misplaced certificate files (i.e.Unsecured Credentials), or directly from the Windows certificate store via various crypto APIs.[4][5][6]With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate authorities (CA). This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions associated with the certificate. Of note, the certificate’s extended key usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases, while the certificate’s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the certificate owner’s alternate names.[7]Abusing certificates for authentication credentials may enable other behaviors such asLateral Movement. Certificate-related misconfigurations may also enable opportunities forPrivilege Escalation, by way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate. These abuses may also enablePersistencevia stealing or forging certificates that can be used asValid Accountsfor the duration of the certificate's validity, despite user password resets. Authentication certificates can also be stolen and forged for machine accounts.Adversaries who have access to root (or subordinate) CA certificate private keys (or mechanisms protecting/managing these keys) may also establishPersistenceby forging arbitrary authentication certificates for the victim domain (known as "golden" certificates).[7]Adversaries may also target certificates and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such asGolden Ticketticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.[7]ID:T1649Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Lee Christensen, SpecterOps; Thirumalai Natarajan, Mandiant; Tristan Bennett, Seamless IntelligenceVersion:1.1Created:03 August 2022Last Modified:02 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan create and export various authentication certificates, including those associated with Azure AD joined/registered devices.[8]G0016APT29APT29has abused misconfigured AD CS certificate templates to impersonate admin users and create additional authentication certificates.[9]S0002MimikatzMimikatz'sCRYPTOmodule can create and export various types of authentication certificates.[10]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1015Active Directory ConfigurationEnsure certificate authorities (CA) are properly secured, including treating CA servers (and other resources hosting CA certificates) as tier 0 assets. Harden abusable CA settings and attributes.For example, consider disabling the usage of AD CS certificate SANs within relevant authentication protocol settings to enforce strict user mappings and prevent certificates from authenticating as other identifies.[4]Also consider enforcing CA Certificate Manager approval for the templates that include SAN as an issuance requirement.M1047AuditCheck and remediate unneeded existing authentication certificates as well as common abusable misconfigurations of CA settings and permissions, such as AD CS certificate enrollment permissions and published overly permissive certificate templates (which define available settings for created certificates). For example, available AD CS certificate templates can be checked via the Certificate Authority MMC snap-in (certsrv.msc).certutil.execan also be used to examine various information within an AD CS CA database.[4][11][12]M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider disabling old/dangerous authentication protocols (e.g. NTLM), as well as unnecessary certificate features, such as potentially vulnerable AD CS web and other enrollment server roles.[4]M1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnsure certificates as well as associated private keys are appropriately secured. Consider utilizing additional hardware credential protections such as trusted platform modules (TPM) or hardware security modules (HSM).
