Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using aCredential Accesstechnique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to "overpass the hash." Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to performPass the Ticketattacks.[1]ID:T1550.002Sub-technique of:T1550ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:System Access ControlsContributors:Blake Strom, Microsoft 365 Defender; Travis Smith, TripwireVersion:1.2Created:30 January 2020Last Modified:28 July 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0006APT1TheAPT1group is known to have used pass the hash.[2]G0007APT28APT28has used pass the hash for lateral movement.[3]G0050APT32APT32has used pass the hash for lateral movement.[4]G0096APT41APT41uses tools such asMimikatzto enable lateral movement via captured password hashes.[5]S1081BADHATCHBADHATCHcan perform pass the hash on compromised machines with x64 versions.[6]G0114ChimeraChimerahas dumped password hashes for use in pass the hash authentication attacks.[7]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan perform pass the hash.[8]S0488CrackMapExecCrackMapExeccan pass the hash to authenticate via SMB.[9]S0363EmpireEmpirecan perform pass the hash attacks.[10]G1016FIN13FIN13has used the PowerShell utilityInvoke-SMBExecto execute the pass the hash method for lateral movement within an compromised environment.[11]G0093GALLIUMGALLIUMused dumped hashes to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash.[12]S0376HOPLIGHTHOPLIGHThas been observed loading several APIs associated with Pass the Hash.[13]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used pass the hash for authentication to remote access software used in C2.[14]S0002MimikatzMimikatz'sSEKURLSA::Pthmodule can impersonate a user, with only a password hash, to execute arbitrary commands.[15][16][17]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors used pass-the-hash tools to obtain authenticated access to sensitive internal desktops and servers.[18]S0122Pass-The-Hash ToolkitPass-The-Hash Toolkitcan perform pass the hash.[2]S0378PoshC2PoshC2has a number of modules that leverage pass the hash for lateral movement.[19]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas used theInvoke-SMBExecPowerShell cmdlet to execute the pass-the-hash technique and utilized stolen password hashes to move laterally.[20]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit credential overlap across systems to prevent the damage of credential compromise and reduce the adversary's ability to perform Lateral Movement between systems.M1051Update SoftwareApply patch KB2871997 to Windows 7 and higher systems to limit the default access of accounts in the local administrator group.[21]M1052User Account ControlEnable pass the hash mitigations to apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logon.

Windows Security events such as 4768 (A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested) and 4769 (A Kerberos service ticket was requested) combined with logon session creation information may be indicative of an overpass the hash attempt.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor newly created logons and credentials used in events and review for discrepancies. Unusual remote logins that correlate with other suspicious activity (such as writing and executing binaries) may indicate malicious activity.Note: Analytic Event ID is for Windows Security Log (Event ID 4624 - An account was successfully logged on). The successful use of Pass the Hash for lateral movement between workstations would trigger Event ID 4624, with an event level of Information, from the Windows Security log. This event would show an account logon with a LogonType of 3 using NTLM authentication, a logon that is not a domain logon, and the user account not being the ANONYMOUS LOGON account.Analytic 1 - Successful Local Account Login(source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4624") TargetUser= "ANONYMOUS LOGON" AND AuthenticationPackageName="NTLM"DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for user authentication attempts. From a classic Pass-The-Hash perspective, this technique uses a hash through the NTLMv1 / NTLMv2 protocol to authenticate against a compromised endpoint. This technique does not touch Kerberos. Therefore, NTLM LogonType 3 authentications that are not associated to a domain login and are not anonymous logins are suspicious. From an Over-Pass-The-Hash perspective, an adversary wants to exchange the hash for a Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT). One way to do this is by creating a sacrificial logon session with dummy credentials (LogonType 9) and then inject the hash into that session which triggers the Kerberos authentication process.ReferencesWarren, J.
