Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, such as watering hole operations inDrive-by Compromise, enablingPhishingoperations, or facilitatingCommand and Control. Instead of compromising a third-partyServeror renting aVirtual Private Server, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.[1][2]Adversaries may only need a lightweight setup if most of their activities will take place using online infrastructure. Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.[3]ID:T1583.004Sub-technique of:T1583ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Dor Edry, MicrosoftVersion:1.3Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:28 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas acquired multiple servers for some of their operations, using each server for a different role.[4]G0093GALLIUMGALLIUMhas used Taiwan-based servers that appear to be exclusive toGALLIUM.[5]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas purchased hosting servers with virtual currency and prepaid cards.[6]G1020Mustard TempestMustard Tempesthas acquired servers to host second-stage payloads that remain active for a period of either days, weeks, or months.[7]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors purchased hosted services to use for C2.[8]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupacquired servers to host their malicious tools.[9]C0006Operation HoneybeeForOperation Honeybee, at least one identified persona was used to register for a free account for a control server.[10]C0014Operation WocaoForOperation Wocao, the threat actors purchased servers with Bitcoin to use during the operation.[11]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas leased servers from resellers instead of leasing infrastructure directly from hosting companies to enable its operations.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned a server (ex: for use as a command and control server), internet scans may reveal servers that adversaries have acquired. Consider looking for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software.[13][14][15]Response MetadataMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.ReferencesGamazo, William. Quist, Nathaniel.. (2023, January 5).
