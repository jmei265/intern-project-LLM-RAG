Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex:Ingress Tool Transfer) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.There are tools available from the host operating system to perform cleanup, but adversaries may use other tools as well.[1]Examples of built-inCommand and Scripting Interpreterfunctions includedelon Windows andrmorunlinkon Linux and macOS.ID:T1070.004Sub-technique of:T1070ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Host forensic analysisContributors:Walker JohnsonVersion:1.1Created:31 January 2020Last Modified:16 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, vba_macro.exe deletes itself afterFONTCACHE.DAT,rundll32.exe, and the associated .lnk file is delivered.[2]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLcan delete files and directories.[3]S0504AnchorAnchorcan self delete its dropper after the malware is successfully deployed.[4]S0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas deleted the MSI file after installation.[5]S0622AppleSeedAppleSeedcan delete files from a compromised host after they are exfiltrated.[6]G0026APT18APT18actors deleted tools and batch files from victim systems.[7]G0007APT28APT28has intentionally deleted computer files to cover their tracks, including with use of the program CCleaner.[8]G0016APT29APT29has usedSDeleteto remove artifacts from victim networks.[9]G0022APT3APT3has a tool that can delete files.[10]G0050APT32APT32's macOS backdoor can receive a "delete" command.[11]G0082APT38APT38has used a utility called CLOSESHAVE that can securely delete a file from the system.
