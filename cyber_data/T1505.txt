Enterprise server applications may include features that allow developers to write and install software or scripts to extend the functionality of the main application. Adversaries may install malicious components to extend and abuse server applications.[1]ID:T1505Sub-techniques:T1505.001,T1505.002,T1505.003,T1505.004,T1505.005ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSVersion:1.4Created:28 June 2019Last Modified:19 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditRegularly check component software on critical services that adversaries may target for persistence to verify the integrity of the systems and identify if unexpected changes have been made.M1045Code SigningEnsure all application component binaries are signed by the correct application developers.M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider disabling software components from servers when possible to prevent abuse by adversaries.[2]M1026Privileged Account ManagementDo not allow administrator accounts that have permissions to add component software on these services to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries on unprivileged systems.M1024Restrict Registry PermissionsConsider using Group Policy to configure and block modifications to service and other critical server parameters in the Registry.[3]M1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least privilege by limiting privileges of user accounts so only authorized accounts can modify and/or add server software components.[4]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may abuse legitimate extensible development features of servers to establish persistent access to systems. Consider monitoring application logs for abnormal behavior that may indicate suspicious installation of application software components. Log authentication attempts to the server and any unusual traffic patterns to or from the server and internal network.[5]DS0022FileFile CreationConsider monitoring file locations associated with the installation of new application software components such as paths from which applications typically load such extensible components.File ModificationMonitor for changes made to files that may abuse legitimate extensible development features of servers to establish persistent access to systems.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).[5]Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationProcess monitoring may be used to detect servers components that perform suspicious actions such as running cmd.exe or accessing files.ReferencesAdair, S., Lancaster, T., Volexity Threat Research.
