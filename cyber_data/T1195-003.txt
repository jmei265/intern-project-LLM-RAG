By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.ID:T1195.003Sub-technique of:T1195ⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:11 March 2020Last Modified:28 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1046Boot IntegrityUse Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from being compromised.
