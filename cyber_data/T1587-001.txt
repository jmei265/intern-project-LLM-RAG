Building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.[1][2][3][4]As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing malware. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's malware development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the malware.Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure. For example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use ofWeb Services.[5]ID:T1587.001Sub-technique of:T1587ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:14 January 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1007Aoqin DragonAoqin Dragonhas used custom malware, includingMongallandHeyoka Backdoor, in their operations.[6]G0016APT29APT29has used unique malware in many of their operations.[7][8][9][10]C0010C0010ForC0010, UNC3890 actors used unique malware, includingSUGARUSHandSUGARDUMP.[11]G0003CleaverCleaverhas created customized tools and payloads for functions including ARP poisoning, encryption, credential dumping, ASP.NET shells, web backdoors, process enumeration, WMI querying, HTTP and SMB communications, network interface sniffing, and keystroke logging.[12]C0004CostaRictoForCostaRicto, the threat actors used custom malware, includingPS1,CostaBricks, andSombRAT.[13]G1016FIN13FIN13has utilized custom malware to maintain persistence in a compromised environment.[14][15]G0046FIN7FIN7has developed malware for use in operations, including the creation of infected removable media.[4][16]G0119Indrik SpiderIndrik Spiderhas developed malware for their operations, including ransomware such asBitPaymerandWastedLocker.[17]G0004Ke3changKe3changhas developed custom malware that allowed them to maintain persistence on victim networks.[18]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas developed its own unique malware such as MailFetch.py for use in operations.[19][20]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas developed custom malware for use in their operations.[21][22]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas used unique malware for information theft and exfiltration.[23][24]G1009Moses StaffMoses Staffhas built malware, such asDCSrvandPyDCrypt, for targeting victims' machines.[25]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupdeveloped custom tools such as Sumarta, DBLL Dropper,Torisma, andDRATzarusfor their operations.[26][27][28][29]C0023Operation GhostForOperation Ghost,APT29used new strains of malware includingFatDuke,MiniDuke,RegDuke, andPolyglotDuke.[30]C0013Operation SharpshooterForOperation Sharpshooter, the threat actors used theRising Sunmodular backdoor.[31]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors developed their own custom webshells to upload to compromised servers.[32]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas developed malware for its operations, including malicious mobile applications and destructive malware such asNotPetyaandOlympic Destroyer.[33]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseFor theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used numerous pieces of malware that were likely developed for or by the group, includingSUNBURST,SUNSPOT,Raindrop, andTEARDROP.[34][35][36]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas developed custom malware such asHildegard.[37]C0030Triton Safety Instrumented System AttackIn theTriton Safety Instrumented System Attack,TEMP.Velesdeveloped, prior to the attack, malware capabilities that would require access to specific and specialized hardware and software.[38]G0010TurlaTurlahas developed its own unique malware for use in operations.[39]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0004Malware RepositoryMalware ContentConsider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with the adversary and/or their developers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, or code similarities. Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples associated with the adversary and identify development patterns over time.Malware MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a malicious payload, such as compilation times, file hashes, as well as watermarks or other identifiable configuration information. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle.ReferencesMandiant. (n.d.). APT1 Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.
