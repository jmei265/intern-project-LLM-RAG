Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such asWindows Remote ManagementandVNCcan also be used externally.[1]Access toValid Accountsto use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.[2]Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.[3][4]ID:T1133Sub-techniques:No

to access an exposed remote service, monitor for follow-on activities such as anomalous external use of the exposed API or application.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session MetadataFollow best practices for detecting adversary use ofValid Accountsfor authenticating to remote services. Collect authentication logs and analyze for unusual access patterns, windows of activity, and access outside of normal business hours.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may use Valid Accounts to access and/or persist within a network using External Remote Services. Use of External Remote Services may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it’s used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior using External Remote Services.Network Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.ReferencesApple Support. (n.d.).
