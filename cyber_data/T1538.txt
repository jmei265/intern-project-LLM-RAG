For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.[1]Depending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API. This allows the adversary to gain information without making any API requests.ID:T1538Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:Obsidian Security; PraetorianVersion:1.3Created:30 August 2019Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderabused AWS Systems Manager Inventory to identify targets on the compromised network prior to lateral movement.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege by limiting dashboard visibility to only the resources required.
