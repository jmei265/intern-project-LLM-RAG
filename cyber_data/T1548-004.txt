This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS. When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made. The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.Adversaries may abuseAuthorizationExecuteWithPrivilegesto obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.[2][3][4]This technique may be combined withMasqueradingto trick the user into granting escalated privileges to malicious code.[2][3]This technique has also been shown to work by modifying legitimate programs present on the machine that make use of this API.[2]ID:T1548.004Sub-technique of:T1548ⓘTactics:Privilege Escalation,Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserⓘEffective Permissions:rootContributors:Erika Noerenberg, @gutterchurl, Carbon Black; Jimmy Astle, @AstleJimmy, Carbon BlackVersion:1.0Created:30 January 2020Last Modified:19 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0402OSX/ShlayerOSX/Shlayercan escalate privileges to root by asking the user for credentials.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionSystem settings can prevent applications from running that haven't been downloaded through the Apple Store which may help mitigate some of these issues. Not allowing unsigned applications from being run may also mitigate some risk.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitoring OS API callbacks for the execution can also be a way to detect this behavior but requires specialized security tooling.Process CreationConsider monitoring for/usr/libexec/security_authtrampolineexecutions which may indicate thatAuthorizationExecuteWithPrivilegesis being executed.
