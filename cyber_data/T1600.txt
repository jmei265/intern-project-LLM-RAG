Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such asModify System Image,Reduce Key Space, andDisable Crypto Hardware, an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts.[2]ID:T1600Sub-techniques:T1600.001,T1600.002ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorⓘDefense Bypassed:EncryptionVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
