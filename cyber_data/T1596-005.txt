Various online services continuously publish the results of Internet scans/surveys, often harvesting information such as active IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, certificates, and even server banners.[1]Adversaries may search scan databases to gather actionable information. Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services. Adversaries may seek information about their already identified targets, or use these datasets to discover opportunities for successful breaches. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Active ScanningorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Develop CapabilitiesorObtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex:External Remote ServicesorExploit Public-Facing Application).ID:T1596.005Sub-technique of:T1596ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41APT41uses the Chinese website fofa.su, similar to the Shodan scanning service, for passive scanning of victims.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesShodan.
