Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device viaNetwork Device CLI(e.g.reload).[1][2]Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users while also impeding incident response/recovery.Adversaries may attempt to shutdown/reboot a system after impacting it in other ways, such asDisk Structure WipeorInhibit System Recovery, to hasten the intended effects on system availability.[3][4]ID:T1529Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; Hubert MankVersion:1.3Created:04 October 2019Last Modified:22 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1125AcidRainAcidRainreboots the target system once the various wiping processes are complete.[5]G0067APT37APT37has used malware that will issue the commandshutdown /r /t 1to reboot a system after wiping its MBR.[6]G0082APT38APT38has used a custom MBR wiper named BOOTWRECK, which will initiate a system reboot after wiping the victim's MBR.[7]S1053AvosLockerAvosLocker’s Linux variant has terminated ESXi virtual machines.[8]S1033DCSrvDCSrvhas a function to sleep for two hours before rebooting the system.[9]S0697HermeticWiperHermeticWipercan initiate a system shutdown.[10][11]S0607KillDiskKillDiskattempts to reboot the machine by terminating specific processes.[12]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas rebooted systems after destroying files and wiping the MBR on infected systems.[13]S0372LockerGogaLockerGogahas been observed shutting down infected systems.[14]S0582LookBackLookBackcan shutdown and reboot the victim machine.[15]S0449MazeMazehas issued a shutdown command on a victim machine that, upon reboot, will run the ransomware within a VM.[16]S0368NotPetyaNotPetyawill reboot the system one hour after infection.[3][17]S0365Olympic DestroyerOlympic Destroyerwill shut down the compromised system after it is done modifying system configuration settings.[4][17]S0140ShamoonShamoonwill reboot the infected system once the wiping functionality has been completed.[18][19]S0689WhisperGateWhisperGatecan shutdown a compromised host through execution ofExitWindowsExwith theEXW_SHUTDOWNflag.[20]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
