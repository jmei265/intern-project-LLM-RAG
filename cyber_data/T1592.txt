Information about hosts may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: name, assigned IP, functionality, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its configuration (ex: operating system, language, etc.).Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions viaActive ScanningorPhishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1]Information about hosts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Develop CapabilitiesorObtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex:Supply Chain CompromiseorExternal Remote Services).ID:T1592Sub-techniques:T1592.001,T1592.002,T1592.003,T1592.004ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentInternet scanners may be used to look for patterns associated with malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[2][1]Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesBlasco, J. (2014, August 28).
