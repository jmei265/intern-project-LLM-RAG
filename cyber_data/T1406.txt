This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plaintext strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery. Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.[1]ID:T1406Sub-techniques:T1406.001,T1406.002Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-21Version:3.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:09 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmuhas encoded files, such as exploit binaries, to potentially use during and after the rooting process.[2]S1095AhRatAhRatcan use an encryption key received from its C2 to encrypt and decrypt configuration files and exfiltrated data.[3]S0525Android/AdDisplay.AshasAndroid/AdDisplay.Ashashas hidden the C2 server address using base-64 encoding.[4]S0524AndroidOS/MalLocker.BAndroidOS/MalLocker.Bhas employed both name mangling and meaningless variable names in source.AndroidOS/MalLocker.Bhas stored encrypted payload code in the Assets directory, coupled with a custom decryption routine that assembles a .dex file by passing data through Android Intent objects.[1]S0540AsacubAsacubhas stored encrypted strings in the APK file.[5]S0293BrainTestBrainTeststores a secondary Android app package (APK) in its assets directory in encrypted form, and decrypts the payload at runtime.[6]S1094BRATABRATAhas employed code obfuscation and encryption of configuration files.[7][8]S0432BreadBreaduses various tricks to obfuscate its strings including standard and custom encryption, programmatically building strings at runtime, and splitting unencrypted strings with repeated delimiters to break up keywords.Breadhas also abused Java and JavaScript features to obfuscate code.Breadpayloads have hidden code in native libraries and encrypted JAR files in the data section of an ELF file.Breadhas stored DEX payloads as base64-encoded strings in the Android manifest and internal Java classes.[9][10]C0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto obfuscate code and strings to evade detection.[11]S0529CarbonStealCarbonStealhas used incorrect file extensions and encryption to hide most of its assets, including secondary APKs, configuration files, and JAR or DEX files.[12]S0480CerberusCerberususes standard payload and string obfuscation techniques.[13]S0323ChargerChargerencodes strings into binary arrays to make it difficult to inspect them.

Some application vetting techniques apply reputation analysis of the application developer and can alert to potentially suspicious applications without actual examination of application code.ReferencesD.
