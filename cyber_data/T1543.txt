When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services.[1]On macOS, launchd processes known asLaunch DaemonandLaunch Agentare run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.[2]Adversaries may install new services, daemons, or agents that can be configured to execute at startup or a repeatable interval in order to establish persistence. Similarly, adversaries may modify existing services, daemons, or agents to achieve the same effect.Services, daemons, or agents may be created with administrator privileges but executed under root/SYSTEM privileges. Adversaries may leverage this functionality to create or modify system processes in order to escalate privileges.[3]ID:T1543Sub-techniques:T1543.001,T1543.002,T1543.003,T1543.004,T1543.005ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Containers, Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.2Created:10 January 2020Last Modified:15 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0401Exaramel for LinuxExaramel for Linuxhas a hardcoded location that it uses to achieve persistence if the startup system is Upstart or System V and it is running as root.[4]S1121LITTLELAMB.WOOLTEALITTLELAMB.WOOLTEAcan initialize itself as a daemon to run persistently in the background.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditUse auditing tools capable of detecting privilege and service abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them.M1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent an application from writing a signed vulnerable driver to the system.[6]On Windows 10 and 11, enable Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist to assist in hardening against third party-developed drivers.[7]M1045Code SigningEnforce registration and execution of only legitimately signed service drivers where possible.M1033Limit Software InstallationRestrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages.M1028Operating System ConfigurationEnsure that Driver Signature Enforcement is enabled to restrict unsigned drivers from being installed.M1026Privileged Account ManagementManage the creation, modification, use, and permissions associated to privileged accounts, including SYSTEM and root.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsRestrict read/write access to system-level process files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services.M1054Software ConfigurationWhere possible, consider enforcing the use of container services in rootless mode to limit the possibility of privilege escalation or malicious effects on the host running the container.M1018User Account ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with system-level process changes and service configurations.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand-line invocation of tools capable of modifying services may be unusual, depending on how systems are typically used in a particular environment.
