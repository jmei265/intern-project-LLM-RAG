This hides the fact that it is installed, and can make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions.This behavior has been seen in the BankBot/Spy Banker family of malware.[1][2][3]Beginning in Android 10, changes were introduced to inhibit malicious applications’ ability to hide their icon. If an app is a system app, requests no permissions, or does not have a launcher activity, the application’s icon will be fully hidden. Further, if the device is fully managed or the application is in a work profile, the icon will be fully hidden. Otherwise, a synthesized activity is shown, which is a launcher icon that represents the app’s details page in the system settings. If the user clicks the synthesized activity in the launcher, they are taken to the application’s details page in the system settings.[4][5]ID:T1628.001Sub-technique of:T1628Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:AndroidContributors:Emily Ratliff, IBMVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0440Agent SmithAgent Smithcan hide its icon from the application launcher.[6]S0525Android/AdDisplay.AshasAndroid/AdDisplay.Ashascan hide its icon and create a shortcut based on the C2 server response.[7]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan hide its icon.[8]S0480CerberusCerberushides its icon from the application drawer after being launched for the first time.[9]S0505Desert ScorpionDesert Scorpioncan hide its icon.[10]S0550DoubleAgentDoubleAgenthas hidden its app icon.[11]S1054DrinikDrinikcan hide its application icon.[12]S0509FakeSpyFakeSpycan hide its icon if it detects that it is being run on an emulator.[13]S0408FlexiSpyFlexiSpyis capable of hiding SuperSU's icon if it is installed and visible.[14]FlexiSpycan also hide its own icon to make detection and the uninstallation process more difficult.[15]S1103FlixOnlineFlixOnlinecan hide its application icon.[16]S0423GinpGinphides its icon after installation.[17]S0406GustuffGustuffhides its icon after installation.[18]S0485MandrakeMandrakecan hide its icon on older Android versions.[19]S0411RotexyRotexyhides its icon after first launch.[20]S1062S.O.V.A.S.O.V.A.can hide its application icon.[21]S0419SimBadSimBadhides its icon from the application launcher.[22]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Procan hide its icon after launch.[23]S0302TwitoorTwitoorcan hide its presence on the system.[24]S0418ViceLeakerViceLeakerincludes code to hide its icon, but the function does not appear to be called in an analyzed version of the software.[25]S0311YiSpecterYiSpecterhas hidden the app icon from iOS springboard.[26]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionAndroid 10 introduced changes to prevent malicious applications from fully suppressing their icon in the launcher.[4][5]M1011User GuidanceUsers should be shown what a synthetic activity looks like so they can scrutinize them in the future.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could potentially detect the usage of APIs intended for suppressing the application’s icon.DS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsThe user can examine the list of all installed applications, including those with a suppressed icon, in the device settings.
