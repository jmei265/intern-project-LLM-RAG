On Android and iOS, APIs and libraries exist to facilitate scheduling tasks to execute at a specified date, time, or interval.On Android, theWorkManagerAPI allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system.WorkManagerwas introduced to unify task scheduling on Android, usingJobScheduler,GcmNetworkManager, andAlarmManagerinternally.WorkManageroffers a lot of flexibility for scheduling, including periodically, one time, or constraint-based (e.g. only when the device is charging).[1]On iOS, theNSBackgroundActivitySchedulerAPI allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system. The tasks can be scheduled to be repeating or non-repeating, however, the system chooses when the tasks will be executed. The app can choose the interval for repeating tasks, or the delay between scheduling and execution for one-time tasks.[2]ID:T1603Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Execution,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSContributors:Lorin Wu, Trend MicroVersion:1.0Created:04 November 2020Last Modified:24 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0536GPlayedGPlayedhas used timers to enable Wi-Fi, ping the C2 server, register the device with the C2, and register wake locks on the system.[3]S0545TERRACOTTATERRACOTTAhas used timer events in React Native to initiate the foreground service.[4]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Prohas contained an alarm that triggers every three minutes and timers for communicating with the C2.[5]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
