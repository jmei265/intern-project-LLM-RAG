Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage.  Similar toFile and Directory Discoveryon a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e.Cloud Infrastructure Discovery) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage.

Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set that is allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by escalation of privileges by the same user, and access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.Cloud Storage EnumerationMonitor cloud logs for API calls used for file or object enumeration for unusual activity. System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Collection and Exfiltration, based on the information obtained.ReferencesAmazon - ListObjectsV2.
