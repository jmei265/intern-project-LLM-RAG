Information about network topologies may include a variety of details, including the physical and/or logical arrangement of both external-facing and internal network environments. This information may also include specifics regarding network devices (gateways, routers, etc.) and other infrastructure.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions viaActive ScanningorPhishing for Information. Information about network topologies may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Search Victim-Owned Websites).[1]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Technical DatabasesorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Acquire InfrastructureorCompromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex:External Remote Services).ID:T1590.004Sub-technique of:T1590ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1016FIN13FIN13has searched for infrastructure that can provide remote access to an environment for targeting efforts.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesHacker Target.
