SharePoint will often contain useful information for an adversary to learn about the structure and functionality of the internal network and systems. For example, the following is a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:Policies, procedures, and standardsPhysical / logical network diagramsSystem architecture diagramsTechnical system documentationTesting / development credentialsWork / project schedulesSource code snippetsLinks to network shares and other internal resourcesID:T1213.002Sub-technique of:T1213ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Office 365, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:14 February 2020Last Modified:08 June 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1024AkiraAkirahas accessed and downloaded information stored in SharePoint instances as part of data gathering and exfiltration activity.[1]G0007APT28APT28has collected information from Microsoft SharePoint services within target networks.[2]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spideraccessed victim SharePoint environments to search for VPN and MFA enrollment information, help desk instructions, and new hire guides.[3]G0114ChimeraChimerahas collected documents from the victim's SharePoint.[4]G0004Ke3changKe3changused a SharePoint enumeration and data dumping tool known as spwebmember.[5]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has searched a victim's network for collaboration platforms like SharePoint to discover further high-privilege account credentials.[6][7]S0227spwebmemberspwebmemberis used to enumerate and dump information from Microsoft SharePoint.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditConsider periodic review of accounts and privileges for critical and sensitive SharePoint repositories.M1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege.

Monitor access to Microsoft SharePoint repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across Microsoft's SharePoint which can be configured to report access to certain pages and documents.[8]As information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial.ReferencesSecureworks.
