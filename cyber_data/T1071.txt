Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, or DNS. For connections that occur internally within an enclave (such as those between a proxy or pivot node and other nodes), commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP.[1]ID:T1071Sub-techniques:T1071.001,T1071.002,T1071.003,T1071.004ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Duane MichaelVersion:2.2Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:17 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0660ClamblingClamblinghas the ability to use Telnet for communication.[2]S0038DuquDuquuses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols.[3]S0601HildegardHildegardhas used an IRC channel for C2 communications.[4]S0532LuciferLucifercan use the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for communication between the cryptojacking bot and the mining server.[5]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndmalware has used IRC for C2.[6][7]S0034NETEAGLEAdversaries can also useNETEAGLEto establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519.S1084QUIETEXITQUIETEXITcan use an inverse negotiated SSH connection as part of its C2.[1]G0106RockeRockeissued wget requests from infected systems to the C2.[8]S0623SiloscapeSiloscapeconnects to an IRC server for C2.[9]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas used an IRC bot for C2 communications.[10]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1037Filter Network TrafficUse network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering.
