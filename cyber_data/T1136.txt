In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.ID:T1136Sub-techniques:T1136.001,T1136.002,T1136.003ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); PraetorianVersion:2.4Created:14 December 2017Last Modified:31 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamadded a login to a SQL Server withsp_addlinkedsrvlogin.[2]G0119Indrik SpiderIndrik Spiderusedwmic.exeto add a new user to the system.[1]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spidercreates new user identities within the compromised organization.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.M1030Network SegmentationConfigure access controls and firewalls to limit access to domain controllers and systems used to create and manage accounts.M1028Operating System ConfigurationProtect domain controllers by ensuring proper security configuration for critical servers.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit the number of accounts with permissions to create other accounts.
