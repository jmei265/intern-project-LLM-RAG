Msiexec.exe is the command-line utility for the Windows Installer and is thus commonly associated with executing installation packages (.msi).[1]The Msiexec.exe binary may also be digitally signed by Microsoft.Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to launch local or network accessible MSI files. Msiexec.exe can also execute DLLs.[2][3]Since it may be signed and native on Windows systems, msiexec.exe can be used to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse. Msiexec.exe execution may also be elevated to SYSTEM privileges if theAlwaysInstallElevatedpolicy is enabled.[4]ID:T1218.007Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Alexandros Pappas; Ziv Kaspersky, CymptomVersion:2.0Created:24 January 2020Last Modified:19 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas been installed via MSI installer.[5]S0631ChaesChaeshas used .MSI files as an initial way to start the infection chain.[6]S0611ClopClopcan use msiexec.exe to disable security tools on the system.[7]S1052DEADEYEDEADEYEcan usemsiexec.exefor execution of malicious DLL.[8]S0038DuquDuquhas usedmsiexecto execute malicious Windows Installer packages.
