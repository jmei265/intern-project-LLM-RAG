Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts. Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP.[1]Windows Services that are run as a "generic" process (ex:svchost.exe) load the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry namedServiceDll.[2]Thetermsrv.dllfile, typically stored in%SystemRoot%\System32\, is the defaultServiceDllvalue for Terminal Services inHKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\.Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access to victimized hosts.[3]Modifications to this DLL could be done to execute arbitrary payloads (while also potentially preserving normaltermsrv.dllfunctionality) as well as to simply enable abusable features of Terminal Services. For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrentRemote Desktop Protocolsessions by either patching thetermsrv.dllfile or modifying theServiceDllvalue to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality.[4][5]On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.ID:T1505.005Sub-technique of:T1505ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:WindowsVersion:1.0Created:28 March 2022Last Modified:18 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditRegularly check component software on critical services that adversaries may target for persistence to verify the integrity of the systems and identify if unexpected changes have been made.M1024Restrict Registry PermissionsConsider using Group Policy to configure and block modifications to Terminal Services parameters in the Registry.[2]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for potential adversary actions to modify Registry values (ex:reg.exe) or modify/replace the legitimatetermsrv.dll.DS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor unexpected changes and/or interactions withtermsrv.dll, which is typically stored in%SystemRoot%\System32\.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor module loads by the Terminal Services process (ex:svchost.exe -k termsvcs) for unexpected DLLs (the default is%SystemRoot%\System32\termsrv.dll, though an adversary could also useMatch Legitimate Name or Locationto potentially conceal a malicious payload).DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor processes with arguments that may potentially highlight adversary actions to modify Registry values (ex:reg.exe) or modify/replace the legitimatetermsrv.dll.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key ModificationMonitor for changes to Registry keys associated withServiceDlland other subkey values underHKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\.ReferencesMicrosoft.
