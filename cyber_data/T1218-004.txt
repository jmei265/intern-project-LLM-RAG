InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries.[1]The InstallUtil binary may also be digitally signed by Microsoft and located in the .NET directories on a Windows system:C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v\InstallUtil.exeandC:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v\InstallUtil.exe.InstallUtil may also be used to bypass application control through use of attributes within the binary that execute the class decorated with the attribute[System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(true)].[2]ID:T1218.004Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Casey Smith; Travis Smith, TripwireVersion:2.0Created:23 January 2020Last Modified:11 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0631ChaesChaeshas used Installutill to download content.[3]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas usedInstallUtil.exeto execute malicious software.[4]G0129Mustang PandaMustang Pandahas usedInstallUtil.exeto execute a malicious Beacon stager.[5]S1018Saint BotSaint Bothad usedInstallUtil.exeto download and deploy executables.[6]S0689WhisperGateWhisperGatehas usedInstallUtil.exeas part of its process to disable Windows Defender.[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramInstallUtil may not be necessary within a given environment.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control configured to block execution of InstallUtil.exe if it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments used before and after the InstallUtil.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of InstallUtil.exe.
