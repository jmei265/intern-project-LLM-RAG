System software binaries are used by the underlying operating system and users over adb or terminal emulators.Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those binaries are executed. For example, malware may come with a pre-compiled malicious binary intended to overwrite the genuine one on the device. Since these binaries may be routinely executed by the system or user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the device.ID:T1645Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-27Version:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0293BrainTestBrainTestuses root privileges (if available) to copy an additional Android app package (APK) to /system/priv-app to maintain persistence even after a factory reset.[1]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan abuse existing root access to copy components into the system partition.[2]S0550DoubleAgentDoubleAgenthas used exploits to root devices and install additional malware on the system partition.[3]S0407MonokleMonoklecan remount the system partition as read/write to install attacker-specified certificates.[4]S0316Pegasus for AndroidPegasus for Androidattempts to modify the device's system partition.[5]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOSmodifies the system partition to maintain persistence.[6]S0294ShiftyBugShiftyBugis auto-rooting adware that embeds itself as a system application, making it nearly impossible to remove.[7]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealermaintains persistence by installing an Android application package (APK) on the system partition.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation could detect devices with unauthorized or unsafe modifications.M1003Lock BootloaderA locked bootloader could prevent unauthorized modifications of protected operating system files.M1001Security UpdatesSecurity updates frequently contain fixes for vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to modify protected operating system files.M1004System Partition IntegrityAndroid includes system partition integrity mechanisms that could detect unauthorized modifications.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could detect applications trying to modify files in protected parts of the operating system.DS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusVerified Boot can detect unauthorized modifications to the system partition.[9]Android’s SafetyNet API provides remote attestation capabilities, which could potentially be used to identify and respond to compromised devices. Samsung Knox provides a similar remote attestation capability on supported Samsung devices.ReferencesChris Dehghanpoor. (2016, January 6).
