RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable namedMarch 25 \u202Excod.scrwill display asMarch 25 rcs.docx. A JavaScript file namedphoto_high_re\u202Egnp.jswill be displayed asphoto_high_resj.png.[1]Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type. A common use of this technique is withSpearphishing Attachment/Malicious Filesince it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.[2][3]RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default.ID:T1036.002Sub-technique of:T1036ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:10 February 2020Last Modified:14 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0098BlackTechBlackTechhas used right-to-left-override to obfuscate the filenames of malicious e-mail attachments.[4]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas used Right-to-Left Override to deceive victims into executing several strains of malware.[5]G0137Ferocious KittenFerocious Kittenhas used right-to-left override to reverse executables’ names to make them appear to have different file extensions, rather than their real ones.[6]G0004Ke3changKe3changhas used the right-to-left override character in spearphishing attachment names to trick targets into executing .scr and .exe files.[7]G0029Scarlet MimicScarlet Mimichas used the left-to-right override character in self-extracting RAR archive spearphishing attachment file names.[8]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
