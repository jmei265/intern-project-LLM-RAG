Adversaries may also conductChange Default File AssociationandMasqueradingto cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.ID:T1565.003Sub-technique of:T1565ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEM, User, rootⓘImpact Type:IntegrityVersion:1.1Created:02 March 2020Last Modified:25 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0082APT38APT38has used DYEPACK.FOX to manipulate PDF data as it is accessed to remove traces of fraudulent SWIFT transactions from the data displayed to the end user.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1030Network SegmentationIdentify critical business and system processes that may be targeted by adversaries and work to isolate and secure those systems against unauthorized access and tampering.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsPrevent critical business and system processes from being replaced, overwritten, or reconfigured to load potentially malicious code.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of a file in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc that would aid in the manipulation of data to hide activityFile ModificationMonitor for unexpected files with manipulated data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityDS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with altering data.
