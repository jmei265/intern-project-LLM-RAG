Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.[1]Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource (e.g. MSSQL) and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center (KDC), potentially making detection more difficult.[2]Password hashes for target services may be obtained usingOS Credential DumpingorKerberoasting.ID:T1558.002Sub-technique of:T1558ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:25 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan be used to forge Kerberos tickets using the password hash of the AZUREADSSOACC account.[3]S0363EmpireEmpirecan leverage its implementation ofMimikatzto obtain and use silver tickets.[4]S0002MimikatzMimikatz's kerberos module can create silver tickets.[5]S1071RubeusRubeuscan create silver tickets.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnable AES Kerberos encryption (or another stronger encryption algorithm), rather than RC4, where possible.[7]M1027Password PoliciesEnsure strong password length (ideally 25+ characters) and complexity for service accounts and that these passwords periodically expire.[7]Also consider using Group Managed Service Accounts or another third party product such as password vaulting.[7]M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit service accounts to minimal required privileges, including membership in privileged groups such as Domain Administrators.[7]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session MetadataMonitor for anomalous Kerberos activity, such as malformed or blank fields in Windows logon/logoff events (Event ID 4624, 4634, 4672).ReferencesSean Metcalf.
