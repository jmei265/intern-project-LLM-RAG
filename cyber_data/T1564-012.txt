AV and other file-based scanners often include exclusions to optimize performance as well as ease installation and legitimate use of applications. These exclusions may be contextual (e.g., scans are only initiated in response to specific triggering events/alerts), but are also often hardcoded strings referencing specific folders and/or files assumed to be trusted and legitimate.[1]Adversaries may abuse these exclusions to hide their file-based artifacts. For example, rather than  tampering with tool settings to add a new exclusion (i.e.,Disable or Modify Tools), adversaries may drop their file-based payloads in default or otherwise well-known exclusions. Adversaries may also useSecurity Software Discoveryand otherDiscovery/Reconnaissanceactivities to both discover and verify existing exclusions in a victim environment.ID:T1564.012Sub-technique of:T1564ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:29 March 2024Last Modified:15 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1049Antivirus/AntimalwareReview and audit file/folder exclusions, and limit scope of exclusions to only what is required where possible.[1]M1013Application Developer GuidanceApplication developers should consider limiting the requirements for custom or otherwise difficult to manage file/folder exclusions.
