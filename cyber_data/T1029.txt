This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.When scheduled exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer the information out of the network, such asExfiltration Over C2 ChannelorExfiltration Over Alternative Protocol.ID:T1029Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:28 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLcollects, compresses, encrypts, and exfiltrates data to the C2 server every 10 minutes.[1]S0667ChrommmeChrommmecan set itself to sleep before requesting a new command from C2.[2]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan set its Beacon payload to reach out to the C2 server on an arbitrary and random interval.[3]S0126ComRATComRAThas been programmed to sleep outside local business hours (9 to 5, Monday to Friday).[4]S0200DipsindDipsindcan be configured to only run during normal working hours, which would make its communications harder to distinguish from normal traffic.[5]S0696FlagproFlagprohas the ability to wait for a specified time interval between communicating with and executing commands from C2.[6]G0126HigaisaHigaisasent the victim computer identifier in a User-Agent string back to the C2 server every 10 minutes.[7]S0283jRATjRATcan be configured to reconnect at certain intervals.[8]S0265KazuarKazuarcan sleep for a specific time and be set to communicate at specific intervals.[9]S0395LightNeuronLightNeuroncan be configured to exfiltrate data during nighttime or working hours.[10]S0211LinfoLinfocreates a backdoor through which remote attackers can change the frequency at which compromised hosts contact remote C2 infrastructure.[11]S0409MacheteMachetesends stolen data to the C2 server every 10 minutes.[12]S1100NinjaNinjacan configure its agent to work only in specific time frames.[13]S0223POWERSTATSPOWERSTATScan sleep for a given number of seconds.[14]S0596ShadowPadShadowPadhas sent data back to C2 every 8 hours.[15]S1019SharkSharkcan pause C2 communications for a specified time.[16]S0444ShimRatShimRatcan sleep when instructed to do so by the C2.[17]S0668TinyTurlaTinyTurlacontacts its C2 based on a scheduled timing set in its configuration.[18]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary command and control infrastructure and malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool command and control signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way to avoid detection by common defensive tools.[19]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.Network Traffic FlowMonitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.ReferencesESET. (2016, October).
