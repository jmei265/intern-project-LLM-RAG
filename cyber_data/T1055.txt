Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.ID:T1055Sub-techniques:T1055.001,T1055.002,T1055.003,T1055.004,T1055.005,T1055.008,T1055.009,T1055.011,T1055.012,T1055.013,T1055.014,T1055.015ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege

of behavior that occur during the injection process. For example, on Windows 10, Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules may prevent Office applications from code injection.[85]M1026Privileged Account ManagementUtilize Yama (ex: /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope) to mitigate ptrace based process injection by restricting the use of ptrace to privileged users only. Other mitigation controls involve the deployment of security kernel modules that provide advanced access control and process restrictions such as SELinux, grsecurity, and AppArmor.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc.File ModificationMonitor for changes made to files that may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process.DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThread,SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread,QueueUserAPC/NtQueueApcThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.[86]Monitoring for Linux specific calls such as the ptrace system call should not generate large amounts of data due to their specialized nature, and can be a very effective method to detect some of the common process injection methods.[87][88][89][90]Process AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.Process MetadataMonitor for process memory inconsistencies, such as checking memory ranges against a known copy of the legitimate module.[91]Process ModificationMonitor for changes made to processes that may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.ReferencesBooz Allen Hamilton   When The Lights Went Out Retrieved. 2019/10/22Chen, J. et al.
