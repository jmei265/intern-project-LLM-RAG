Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content. Adversaries may upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enableIngress Tool Transferby placing it on an Internet accessible web server.Malware may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary (Acquire Infrastructure) or was otherwise compromised by them (Compromise Infrastructure). Malware can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), where decentralized content storage makes the removal of malicious files difficult.[1][2]Adversaries may upload backdoored files, such as application binaries, virtual machine images, or container images, to third-party software stores or repositories (ex: GitHub, CNET, AWS Community AMIs, Docker Hub). By chance encounter, victims may directly download/install these backdoored files viaUser Execution.Masqueradingmay increase the chance of users mistakenly executing these files.ID:T1608.001Sub-technique of:T1608ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Kobi Haimovich, CardinalOpsVersion:1.2Created:17 March 2021Last Modified:11 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0050APT32APT32has hosted malicious payloads in Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive for use during targeting.[1]G1002BITTERBITTERhas registered domains to stage payloads.[3]C0010C0010ForC0010, UNC3890 actors staged malware on their infrastructure for direct download onto a compromised system.[4]C0011C0011ForC0011,Transparent Tribehosted malicious documents on domains registered by the group.[5]C0021C0021ForC0021, the threat actors uploaded malware to websites under their control.[6][7]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas staged malware and malicious files on compromised web servers, GitHub, and Google Drive.[8]G1011EXOTIC LILYEXOTIC LILYhas uploaded malicious payloads to file-sharing services including TransferNow, TransferXL, WeTransfer, and OneDrive.[9]G0046FIN7FIN7has staged legitimate software, that was trojanized to contain an Atera agent installer, on Amazon S3.[10]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas registered domains to stage payloads.[11][12]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas staged malware on fraudulent websites set up to impersonate targeted organizations.[13]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used Blogspot to host malicious content such as beacons, file exfiltrators, and implants.[14]G0140LazyScripterLazyScripterhas hosted open-source remote access Trojans used in its operations in GitHub.[15]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas hosted malicious payloads on Dropbox.[16]G0129Mustang PandaMustang Pandahas hosted malicious payloads on DropBox includingPlugX.[17]G1020Mustard TempestMustard Tempesthas hosted payloads on acquired second-stage servers for periods of either days, weeks, or months.[18]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors uploaded commonly available hacker tools to compromised web servers.[19]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused compromised servers to host malware.[20][21][22][23]C0013Operation SharpshooterForOperation Sharpshooter, the threat actors staged malicious files on Dropbox and other websites.[24]C0005Operation SpalaxForOperation Spalax, the threat actors staged malware and malicious files in legitimate hosting services such as OneDrive or MediaFire.[25]G1008SideCopySideCopyhas used compromised domains to host its malicious payloads.[26]G1018TA2541TA2541has uploaded malware to various platforms including Google Drive, Pastetext, Sharetext, and GitHub.[27][28]G0092TA505TA505has staged malware on actor-controlled domains.[29]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas uploaded backdoored Docker images to Docker Hub.[30]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has hosted malicious payloads on Dropbox.[31]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in malware have been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged malware to make it accessible for targeting.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle, such asUser ExecutionorIngress Tool Transfer.ReferencesAdair, S. and Lancaster, T. (2020, November 6).
