A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike inRevert Cloud Instancewhere an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.An adversary mayCreate Cloud Instance, mount one or more created snapshots to that instance, and then apply a policy that allows the adversary access to the created instance, such as a firewall policy that allows them inbound and outbound SSH access.[1]ID:T1578.001Sub-technique of:T1578ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:IaaSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:PraetorianVersion:1.1Created:09 June 2020Last Modified:08 March 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1091PacuPacucan create snapshots of EBS volumes and RDS instances.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditRoutinely check user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to create snapshots and backups.M1018User Account ManagementLimit permissions for creating snapshots or backups in accordance with least privilege. Organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.[1]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0020SnapshotSnapshot CreationThe creation of a snapshot is a common part of operations within many cloud environments. Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities such as the creation of one or more snapshots and the restoration of these snapshots by a new user account.In AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the creation of snapshots and all API calls for AWS Backup as events. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made, the IP address from which the request was made, which user made the request, when it was made, and additional details.[3]In Azure, the creation of a snapshot may be captured in Azure activity logs. Backup restoration events can also be detected through Azure Monitor Log Data by creating a custom alert for completed restore jobs.[4]Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of the gcloud compute instances create command to create a new VM disk from a snapshot.[5]It is also possible to detect the usage of the GCP API with thesourceSnapshotparameter pointed toglobal/snapshots/[BOOT_SNAPSHOT_NAME].[6]Snapshot MetadataPeriodically baseline snapshots to identify malicious modifications or additions.ReferencesMandiant.
