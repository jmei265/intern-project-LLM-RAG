Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets forValid Accountsare captured byOS Credential Dumping. A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.[1][2]ASilver Ticketcan be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).[1]AGolden Ticketcan be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.[3]Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, "overpassing the hash" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e.Pass the Hash) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.[4]ID:T1550.003Sub-technique of:T1550ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSystem Requirements:Kerberos authentication enabledⓘDefense Bypassed:System Access ControlsContributors:Ryan Becwar; Vincent Le TouxVersion:1.1Created:30 January 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29used Kerberos ticket attacks for lateral movement.[5]G0050APT32APT32successfully gained remote access by using pass the ticket.[6]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas created forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets to maintain administrative access.[7]S0002MimikatzMimikatz’sLSADUMP::DCSyncandKERBEROS::PTTmodules implement the three steps required to extract the krbtgt account hash and create/use Kerberos tickets.[8][9][10][11]S0192PupyPupycan also perform pass-the-ticket.[12]S0053SeaDukeSomeSeaDukesamples have a module to use pass the ticket with Kerberos for authentication.[13]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1015Active Directory ConfigurationTo contain the impact of a previously generated golden ticket, reset the built-in KRBTGT account password twice, which will invalidate any existing golden tickets that have been created with the KRBTGT hash and other Kerberos tickets derived from it.[14]For each domain, change the KRBTGT account password once, force replication, and then change the password a second time. Consider rotating the KRBTGT account password every 180 days.[15]M1027Password PoliciesEnsure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit domain admin account permissions to domain controllers and limited servers.

Event ID 4769 is generated on the Domain Controller when using a golden ticket after the KRBTGT password has been reset twice, as mentioned in the mitigation section. The status code 0x1F indicates the action has failed due to "Integrity check on decrypted field failed" and indicates misuse by a previously invalidated golden ticket.[16]DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationAudit all Kerberos authentication and credential use events and review for discrepancies.
