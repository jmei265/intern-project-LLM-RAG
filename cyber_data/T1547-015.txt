Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.[1]Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.[2]Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such asAppleScript, whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API callSMLoginItemSetEnabled.Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leveragelaunchd, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.[2][3]Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.[4]Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.Adversaries can utilizeAppleScriptandNative APIcalls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.[5]Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by usingAppleScriptto send an Apple events to the "System Events" process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.[6]Adversaries can use a command such astell application "System Events" to make login item at end with properties /path/to/executable.[7][8][9]This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm.[7]Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.[10][11][12]ID:T1547.015Sub-technique of:T1547ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:05 October 2021Last Modified:18 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0281DokDokuses AppleScript to install a login Item by sending Apple events to theSystem Eventsprocess.[8]S0690Green LambertGreen Lambertcan addLogin Itemsto establish persistence.[13][14]S0198NETWIRENETWIREcan persist via startup options for Login items.[15]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Usual applications for login items could include what users add to configure their user environment, such as email, chat, or music applications, or what administrators include for organization settings and protections. Check for running applications from login items that also have abnormal behavior, such as establishing network connections.ReferencesApple. (n.d.). Open items automatically when you log in on Mac.
