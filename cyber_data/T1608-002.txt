Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial. Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex:PsExec). Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enableIngress Tool Transferby placing it on an Internet accessible web server.Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary (Acquire Infrastructure) or was otherwise compromised by them (Compromise Infrastructure).[1]Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo, or on Platform-as-a-Service offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.[2][3][4]Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location (ex: a non-adversary controlled GitHub repo), including the original hosting site of the tool.ID:T1608.002Sub-technique of:T1608ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.2Created:17 March 2021Last Modified:20 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC0010C0010ForC0010, UNC3890 actors staged tools on their infrastructure to download directly onto a compromised system.[5]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused multiple servers to host malicious tools.[6]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has staged tools, includinggsecdumpand WCE, on previously compromised websites.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in tooling have been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged tools to make them accessible for targeting.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle, such asIngress Tool Transfer.ReferencesDell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit Threat Intelligence.
