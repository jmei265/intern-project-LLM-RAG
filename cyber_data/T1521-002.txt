Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private that should not be distributed. Due to how asymmetric algorithms work, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA, ElGamal, and ECDSA.For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified asAsymmetric Cryptography.ID:T1521.002Sub-technique of:T1521Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.0Created:05 April 2022Last Modified:05 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0529CarbonStealCarbonStealhas performed rudimentary SSL certificate validation to verify C2 server authenticity before establishing a SSL connection.[1]S0555CHEMISTGAMESCHEMISTGAMEShas used HTTPS for C2 communication.[2]S0507eSurveSurv’s Android version has used public key encryption for C2 communication.[3]S1067FluBotFluBothas encrypted C2 message bodies with RSA and encoded them in base64.[4]S1055SharkBotSharkBothas used RSA to encrypt the symmetric encryption key used for C2 messages.[5]S0549SilkBeanSilkBeanhas used HTTPS for C2 communication.[1]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
