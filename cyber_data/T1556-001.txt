Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system. Once patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller). Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources within single-factor authentication environments.[1]ID:T1556.001Sub-technique of:T1556ⓘTactics:Credential Access,Defense Evasion,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:2.0Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:20 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0114ChimeraChimera's malware has altered the NTLM authentication program on domain controllers to allowChimerato login without a valid credential.[2]S0007Skeleton KeySkeleton Keyis used to patch an enterprise domain controller authentication process with a backdoor password. It allows adversaries to bypass the standard authentication system to use a defined password for all accounts authenticating to that domain controller.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationIntegrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs.M1026Privileged Account ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account.[3][4]These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.[5]M1025Privileged Process IntegrityEnabled features, such as Protected Process Light (PPL), for LSA.[6]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor for changes to functions exported from authentication-related system DLLs (such as cryptdll.dll and samsrv.dll).[1]DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access). Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services.[7]DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls to OpenProcess that can be used to manipulate lsass.exe running on a domain controllerProcess AccessMonitor for unexpected processes interacting with the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.ReferencesDell SecureWorks.
