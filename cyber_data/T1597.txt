Information about victims may be available for purchase from reputable private sources and databases, such as paid subscriptions to feeds of technical/threat intelligence data.[1]Adversaries may also purchase information from less-reputable sources such as dark web or cybercrime blackmarkets.[2]Adversaries may search in different closed databases depending on what information they seek to gather.
