Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering. When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use ofModify System Image, forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors. This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g.,Reduce Key Space).[1]ID:T1600.002Sub-technique of:T1600ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Detection efforts may be focused on closely related adversary behaviors, such as Modify System Image and Network Device CLI. Some detection methods require vendor support to aid in investigation.ReferencesOmar Santos. (2020, October 19). Attackers Continue to Target Legacy Devices.
