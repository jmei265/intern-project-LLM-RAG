Crashed or restarted applications or systems may also have other effects such asData Destruction,Firmware Corruption,Service Stopetc. which may further cause a DoS condition and deny availability to critical information, applications and/or systems.ID:T1499.004Sub-technique of:T1499ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityVersion:1.2Created:20 February 2020Last Modified:25 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0604IndustroyerIndustroyeruses a custom DoS tool that leverages CVE-2015-5374 and targets hardcoded IP addresses of Siemens SIPROTEC devices.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1037Filter Network TrafficLeverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to filter traffic upstream from services.[3]Filter boundary traffic by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.[1]Attacks targeting web applications may generate logs in the web server, application server, and/or database server that can be used to identify the type of attack. Externally monitor the availability of services that may be targeted by an Endpoint DoS.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusDetection of Endpoint DoS can sometimes be achieved before the effect is sufficient to cause significant impact to the availability of the service, but such response time typically requires very aggressive monitoring and responsiveness. Monitor for logging, messaging, and other artifacts highlighting the health of host sensors (ex: metrics, errors, and/or exceptions from logging applications)ReferencesCid, D.. (2015, August 2).
