The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.[1]Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g.,Hijack Execution Flow), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.ID:T1547.008Sub-technique of:T1547ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEMContributors:Vincent Le TouxVersion:1.0Created:24 January 2020Last Modified:20 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0208PasamPasamestablishes by infecting the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk.[2]S0176WingbirdWingbirddrops a malicious file (sspisrv.dll) alongside a copy of lsass.exe, which is used to register a service that loads sspisrv.dll as a driver.
