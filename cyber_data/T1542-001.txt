Capabilities exist to overwrite the system firmware, which may give sophisticated adversaries a means to install malicious firmware updates as a means of persistence on a system that may be difficult to detect.ID:T1542.001Sub-technique of:T1542ⓘTactics:Persistence,Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Network, WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, File monitoring, Host intrusion prevention systemsContributors:Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET; McAfee; Ryan BecwarVersion:1.1Created:19 December 2019Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0047Hacking Team UEFI RootkitHacking Team UEFI Rootkitis a UEFI BIOS rootkit developed by the company Hacking Team to persist remote access software on some targeted systems.[4]S0397LoJaxLoJaxis a UEFI BIOS rootkit deployed to persist remote access software on some targeted systems.[5]S0001Trojan.MebromiTrojan.Mebromiperforms BIOS modification and can download and execute a file as well as protect itself from removal.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1046Boot IntegrityCheck the integrity of the existing BIOS or EFI to determine if it is vulnerable to modification. Use Trusted Platform Module technology.[7]Move system's root of trust to hardware to prevent tampering with the SPI flash memory.[5]Technologies such as Intel Boot Guard can assist with this.[8]M1026Privileged Account ManagementPrevent adversary access to privileged accounts or access necessary to perform this technique.M1051Update SoftwarePatch the BIOS and EFI as necessary.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0001FirmwareFirmware ModificationMonitor for changes made to firmware.[9]Dump and inspect BIOS images on vulnerable systems and compare against known good images.[10]Analyze differences to determine if malicious changes have occurred. Log attempts to read/write to BIOS and compare against known patching behavior.Likewise, EFI modules can be collected and compared against a known-clean list of EFI executable binaries to detect potentially malicious modules. The CHIPSEC framework can be used for analysis to determine if firmware modifications have been performed.[11][12][13]ReferencesWikipedia. (n.d.). BIOS. Retrieved January 5, 2016.Wikipedia.
