The built-in Windows command-line utilityRegmay be used for local or remote Registry modification.[1]Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read viaRegor other utilities using the Win32 API.[2]Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.[3][4]The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement. It requires the remote Registry service to be running on the target system.[5]OftenValid Accountsare required, along with access to the remote system'sSMB/Windows Admin Sharesfor RPC

The Registry may also be modified through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell, which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic FlowRemote access to the registry can be achieved viaWindows API function RegConnectRegistrycommand line via reg.exegraphically via regedit.exeAll of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe WINREG over SMB to handle the protocol information. This network can be decoded with wireshark or a similar sensor, and can also be detected by hooking the API function.Analytic 1 - Remote Registrysource="Zeek:" (dest_port="445" AND proto_info.pipe="WINREG") OR (proto_info.function="Create" OR proto_info.function="SetValue")DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with concealing Registry keys, such as Reghide.[2]Inspect and cleanup malicious hidden Registry entries using Native Windows API calls and/or tools such as Autoruns[4]and RegDelNull[188]. Other API calls relevant to Registry Modification includeRegOpenKeyExA,RegCreateKeyExA,RegDeleteKeyExA,RegDeleteValueExA,RegEnumKeyExA,RegEnumValueExA, among others.Note: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary.Process CreationMonitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to change, conceal, and/or delete information in the Registry. (i.e. reg.exe, regedit.exe). The analytic is oriented around detecting invocations ofRegwhere the parent executable is an instance of cmd.exe that wasn’t spawned by explorer.exe. The built-in utility reg.exe provides a command-line interface to the registry, so that queries and modifications can be performed from a shell, such as cmd.exe. When a user is responsible for these actions, the parent of cmd.exewill typically be explorer.exe. Occasionally, power users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as well, but likely from a different process tree. These background scripts must be baselined so they can be tuned out accordingly. Analytic Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created).Analytic 1 - Registry Edit with Modification of Userinit, Shell or Notify(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") ((CommandLine="reg" CommandLine="add" CommandLine="/d") OR ((CommandLine="Set-ItemProperty" OR CommandLine="New-ItemProperty") AND CommandLine="-value")) CommandLine="\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon" (CommandLine="Userinit" OR CommandLine="Shell" OR CommandLine="Notify")Analytic 2 - Modification of Default Startup Folder in the Registry Key 'Common Startup'(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") (CommandLine="reg" AND CommandLine="add" AND CommandLine="/d") OR (CommandLine="Set-ItemProperty" AND CommandLine="-value") CommandLine="Common Startup"Analytic 3 - Registry Edit with Creation of SafeDllSearchMode Key Set to 0(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688")((CommandLine="reg" CommandLine="add" CommandLine="/d") OR (CommandLine="Set-ItemProperty" CommandLine="-value")) (CommandLine="00000000" OR CommandLine="0") CommandLine="SafeDllSearchMode")DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key CreationMonitor for newly constructed registry keys or values to aid in persistence and execution. Detection of creation of registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\SafeDllSearchMode. The key SafeDllSearchMode, if set to 0, will block the Windows mechanism for the search DLL order and adversaries may execute their own malicious dll.Analytic 1 - Registry Edit with Creation of SafeDllSearchMode Key Set to 0((source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4657")(ObjectValueName="SafeDllSearchMode" value="0")) OR ((source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="13") EventType="SetValue" TargetObject="*SafeDllSearchMode" Details="DWORD (0x00000000)")))Windows Registry Key DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of windows registry keys to hide configuration information, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.Windows Registry Key ModificationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys or values. Consider enabling Registry Auditing on specific keys to produce an alertable event (Event ID 4657) whenever a value is changed (though this may not trigger when values are created with Reghide or other evasive methods).[189]Changes to Registry entries that load software on Windows startup that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc., are suspicious, as are additions or changes to files within the startup folder. Changes could also include new services and modification of existing binary paths to point to malicious files. If a change to a service-related entry occurs, then it will likely be followed by a local or remote service start or restart to execute the file.Detection of modification of the registry key values of Notify, Userinit, and Shell located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ and HKEY_LOCAL_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon. When a user logs on, the Registry key values of Notify, Userinit and Shell are used to load dedicated Windows component. Attackers may insert malicious payload following the legitimate value to launch a malicious payload.Detection of the modification of the registry key Common Startup located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\ and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders. When a user logs on, any files located in the Startup Folder are launched. Attackers may modify these folders with other files in order to evade detection set on these default folders. This detection focuses on EventIDs 4688 and 1 for process creation and EventID 4657 for the modification of the Registry Keys.Analytic 1 - Registry Edit with Modification of Userinit, Shell or Notifysource="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4657" (ObjectValueName="Userinit" OR ObjectValueName="Shell" OR ObjectValueName="Notify") OR source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="13" (TargetObject="Userinit" OR TargetObject="Shell" OR TargetObject="*Notify")Analytic 2 - Modification of Default Startup Folder in the Registry Key 'Common Startup'(source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4657" ObjectValueName="Common Startup") OR (source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="13" TargetObject="*Common Startup")ReferencesMicrosoft.
