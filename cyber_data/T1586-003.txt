Adversaries can use compromised cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets forExfiltration to Cloud Storageor toUpload Tools. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such asVirtual Private Servers orServerlessinfrastructure. Compromising cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.[1]A variety of methods exist for compromising cloud accounts, such as gathering credentials viaPhishing for Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, conductingPassword Sprayingattacks, or attempting toSteal Application Access Tokens.[2]Prior to compromising cloud accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation. In some cases, adversaries may target privileged service provider accounts with the intent of leveraging aTrusted Relationshipbetween service providers and their customers.[2]ID:T1586.003Sub-technique of:T1586ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Francesco BigarellaVersion:1.0Created:27 May 2022Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has used residential proxies, including Azure Virtual Machines, to obfuscate their access to victim environments.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during exfiltration (ex:Transfer Data to Cloud Account).ReferencesGary Golomb and Tory Kei. (n.d.).
