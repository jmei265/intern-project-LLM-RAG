Encrypting and/or encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such asSoftware Packing,Steganography, andEmbedded Payloads, share this same broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed (i.e.,Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information) at the time of execution/use.This type of file obfuscation can be applied to many file artifacts present on victim hosts, such as malware log/configuration and payload files.[1]Files can be encrypted with a hardcoded or user-supplied key, as well as otherwise obfuscated using standard encoding/compression schemes such as Base64.The entire content of a file may be obfuscated, or just specific functions or values (such as C2 addresses). Encryption and encoding may also be applied in redundant layers for additional protection.For example, adversaries may abuse password-protected Word documents or self-extracting (SFX) archives as a method of encrypting/encoding a file such as aPhishingpayload. These files typically function by attaching the intended archived content to a decompressor stub that is executed when the file is invoked (e.g.,User Execution).[2]Adversaries may also abuse file-specific as well as custom encoding schemes. For example, Byte Order Mark (BOM) headers in text files may be abused to manipulate and obfuscate file content untilCommand and Scripting Interpreterexecution.ID:T1027.013Sub-technique of:T1027ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Andrew Northern, @ex_raritas; David Galazin @themalwareman1; Jai Minton, @CyberraijuVersion:1.0Created:29 March 2024Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0026APT18APT18obfuscates strings in the payload.[3]G0073APT19APT19used Base64 to obfuscate payloads.[4]G0007APT28APT28encrypted a .dll payload using RTL and a custom encryption algorithm.APT28has also obfuscated payloads with base64, XOR, and RC4.[5][6][7][8][9]G0050APT32APT32has performed code obfuscation, including encoding payloads using Base64 and using a framework called "Dont-Kill-My-Cat (DKMC).APT32also encrypts the library used for network exfiltration with AES-256 in CBC mode in their macOS backdoor.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16]G0064APT33APT33has used base64 to encode payloads.[17]G0087APT39APT39has used malware to drop encrypted CAB files.[18]S0456Aria-bodyAria-bodyhas used an encrypted configuration file for its loader.[19]S0373AstarothAstarothhas used an XOR-based algorithm to encrypt payloads twice with different keys.[20]S0438AttorStrings inAttor's components are encrypted with a XOR cipher, using a hardcoded key and the configuration data, log files and plugins are encrypted using a hybrid encryption scheme of Blowfish-OFB combined with RSA.[21]S0347AuditCredAuditCredencrypts the configuration.[22]S0473AvengerAvengerhas the ability to XOR encrypt files to be sent to C2.[23]S1081BADHATCHBADHATCHcan be compressed with the ApLib algorithm.[24]S0534BazarBazarhas used XOR, RSA2, and RC4 encrypted files.[25][26][27]S0574BendyBearBendyBearhas encrypted payloads using RC4 and XOR.[28]S0268BisonalBisonal's DLL file and non-malicious decoy file are encrypted with RC4 and some function name strings are obfuscated.[29][30]S0570BitPaymerBitPaymerhas used RC4-encrypted strings and string hashes to avoid identifiable strings within the binary.[31]G1002BITTERBITTERhas used a RAR SFX dropper to deliver malware.[32]S0520BLINDINGCANBLINDINGCANhas obfuscated code using Base64 encoding.[33]G0108Blue MockingbirdBlue Mockingbirdhas obfuscated the wallet address in the payload binary.[34]S0657BLUELIGHTBLUELIGHThas a XOR-encoded payload.[35]S0415BOOSTWRITEBOOSTWRITEhas encoded its payloads using a ChaCha stream cipher with a 256-bit key and 64-bit Initialization vector (IV) to evade detection.[36]S0484CarberpCarberphas used XOR-based encryption to mask C2 server locations within the trojan.[37]S0348Cardinal RATCardinal RATencodes many of its artifacts and is encrypted (AES-128) when downloaded.[38]S0462CARROTBATCARROTBAThas the ability to download a base64 encoded payload.[39]S1041ChinoxyChinoxyhas encrypted its configuration file.[40]S0667ChrommmeChrommmecan encrypt sections of its code to evade detection.[41]S0046CozyCarThe payload ofCozyCaris encrypted with simple XOR with a rotating key.
