Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems. Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.Adversaries may target these repositories in order to collect large quantities of sensitive system administration data. Data from configuration repositories may be exposed by various protocols and software and can store a wide variety of data, much of which may align with adversary Discovery objectives.[1][2]ID:T1602Sub-techniques:T1602.001,T1602.002ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:NetworkVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:19 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationConfigure SNMPv3 to use the highest level of security (authPriv) available.[2]M1037Filter Network TrafficApply extended ACLs to block unauthorized protocols outside the trusted network.[2]M1031Network Intrusion PreventionConfigure intrusion prevention devices to detect SNMP queries and commands from unauthorized sources.[1]M1030Network SegmentationSegregate SNMP traffic on a separate management network.[2]M1054Software ConfigurationAllowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views.[3]M1051Update SoftwareKeep system images and software updated and migrate to SNMPv3.[4]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts or uncommon data flows.
