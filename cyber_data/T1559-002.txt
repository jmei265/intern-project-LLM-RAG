DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded byComponent Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys.[1][2][3]Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution viaPhishingcampaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.[4][5][6][7]Similarly, adversaries may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV file intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program.[8][9]DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to aCommand and Scripting Interpreter. DDE execution can be invoked remotely viaRemote Servicessuch asDistributed Component Object Model(DCOM).[10]ID:T1559.002Sub-technique of:T1559ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSupports Remote:YesVersion:1.3Created:12 February 2020Last Modified:15 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has deliveredJHUHUGITandKoadicby executing PowerShell commands through DDE in Word documents.[11][12][13]G0067APT37APT37has used Windows DDE for execution of commands and a malicious VBS.[14]G1002BITTERBITTERhas executed OLE objects using Microsoft Equation Editor to download and run malicious payloads.[15]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas sent malicious Word OLE compound documents to victims.[16]G0046FIN7FIN7spear phishing campaigns have included malicious Word documents with DDE execution.[17]G0084GallmakerGallmakerattempted to exploit Microsoft’s DDE protocol in order to gain access to victim machines and for execution.[18]S0237GravityRATGravityRAThas been delivered via Word documents using DDE for execution.[19]S0391HAWKBALLHAWKBALLhas used an OLE object that uses Equation Editor to drop the embedded shellcode.[20]S0387KeyBoyKeyBoyuses the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol to download remote payloads.[21]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas utilized OLE as a method to insert malicious content inside various phishing documents.[22]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas used malware that can execute PowerShell scripts via DDE.[23]C0013Operation SharpshooterDuringOperation Sharpshooter, threat actors sent malicious Word OLE documents to victims.[24]G0040PatchworkPatchworkleveraged the DDE protocol to deliver their malware.[25]S0428PoetRATPoetRATwas delivered with documents using DDE to execute malicious code.[26]S0223POWERSTATSPOWERSTATScan use DDE to execute additional payloads on compromised hosts.[27]S0458RamsayRamsayhas been delivered using OLE objects in malicious documents.[28]S0148RTMRTMcan search for specific strings within browser tabs using a Dynamic Data Exchange mechanism.[29]G0121SidewinderSidewinderhas used the ActiveXObject utility to create OLE objects to obtain execution through Internet Explorer.[30][31]G0092TA505TA505has leveraged malicious Word documents that abused DDE.[32]S0476ValakValakcan execute tasks via OLE.[33]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1048Application Isolation and SandboxingEnsure Protected View is enabled.[34]M1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent DDE attacks and spawning of child processes from Office programs.[35][6]M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramRegistry keys specific to Microsoft Office feature control security can be set to disable automatic DDE/OLE execution.[3][1][36]Microsoft also created, and enabled by default, Registry keys to completely disable DDE execution in Word and Excel.[2]M1054Software ConfigurationConsider disabling embedded files in Office programs, such as OneNote, that do not work with Protected View.[6][36]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor processes for abnormal behavior indicative of DDE abuse, such as Microsoft Office applications loading DLLs and other modules not typically associated with the application or these applications spawning unusual processes (such as cmd.exe).DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands.
