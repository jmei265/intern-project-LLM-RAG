By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.Adversaries may impersonate a fake SSL/TLS handshake to make it look like subsequent traffic is SSL/TLS encrypted, potentially interfering with some security tooling, or to make the traffic look like it is related with a trusted entity.ID:T1001.003Sub-technique of:T1001ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:15 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0245BADCALLBADCALLuses a FakeTLS method during C2.[1]S0239BankshotBankshotgenerates a false TLS handshake using a public certificate to disguise C2 network communications.[2]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41frequently configured the URL endpoints of their stealthy passive backdoor LOWKEY.PASSIVE to masquerade as normal web application traffic on an infected server.[3]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan mimic the HTTP protocol for C2 communication, while hiding the actual data in either an HTTP header, URI parameter, the transaction body, or appending it to the URI.[4]S0076FakeMFakeMC2 traffic attempts to evade detection by resembling data generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers.

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesUS-CERT.
