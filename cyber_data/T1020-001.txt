Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. For example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.[1][2]Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other infrastructure they control. Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible throughROMMONkitorPatch System Image.[3][4]Many cloud-based environments also support traffic mirroring. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.[5][6][7]Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction withNetwork Sniffing,Input Capture, orAdversary-in-the-Middledepending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.ID:T1020.001Sub-technique of:T1020ⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:IaaS, NetworkVersion:1.2Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:14 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately.

Consider analyzing newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts, unexpcted hardware devices, or other uncommon data flows.ReferencesCisco. (n.d.).
