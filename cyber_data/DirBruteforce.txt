You can perform a directory brute force attack in order to discover any hidden files and directories on the webserver. Several tools are available to perform this attack:

    Dirb

    DirBuster

    Gobuster

This section shows how to use Gobuster. To use Gobuster, you need to provide a wordlist for Gobuster to run the directory scan with. This guide uses the popular wordlist collection called SecLists.

    Return to your Kali SSH session in your terminal. Gobuster should be installed by default on Kali. On other Debian-based distributions, you can install it with apt:

    sudo apt install gobuster -y

    The wordlists from SecLists should be downloaded to your VM. On Kali, you can install the seclists package:

    sudo apt install seclists -y

    Installing this package places the wordlists in the /usr/share/seclists directory. Other methods for downloading the wordlists are provided in the SecLists GitHub repository

    Perform the directory brute force attack against the web server with Gobuster. Replace $RAVEN_VM_IP in this command with your Raven VMâ€™s IP:

    gobuster dir --url http://$RAVEN_VM_IP --wordlist /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt

    This command uses the big.txt wordlist that is part of the SecLists collection.
