Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes.[1][2]These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar toCommand and Scripting Interpreter, the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.Native API functions (such asNtCreateProcess) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.[3][4][5]For example, functions such as the Windows APICreateProcess()or GNUfork()will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.[6][7]This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.[8][9][10]Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.[11][12][13][14]Adversaries may use assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive sensors and detection signatures such as user mode API-hooks.[15]Adversaries may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API monitoring, such as unhooking monitored functions viaDisable or Modify Tools.ID:T1106Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Gordon Long, Box, Inc., @ethicalhax; Stefan Kanthak; Tristan Madani (Cybereason)Version:2.2Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:13 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLis capable of starting a process using CreateProcess.[16]S1129AkiraAkiraexecutes native Windows functions such asGetFileAttributesWandGetSystemInfo.[17]S1025AmadeyAmadeyhas used a variety of Windows API calls, includingGetComputerNameA,GetUserNameA, andCreateProcessA.[18]S0622AppleSeedAppleSeedhas the ability to use multiple dynamically resolved API calls.[19]G0067APT37APT37leverages the Windows API calls: VirtualAlloc(), WriteProcessMemory(), and CreateRemoteThread() for process injection.[20]G0082APT38APT38has used the Windows API to execute code within a victim's system.[21]S0456Aria-bodyAria-bodyhas the ability to launch files usingShellExecute.[22]S1087AsyncRATAsyncRAThas the ability to use OS APIs includingCheckRemoteDebuggerPresent.[23]S0438AttorAttor's dispatcher has used CreateProcessW API for execution.[24]S0640AvaddonAvaddonhas used the Windows Crypto API to generate an AES key.[25]S1053AvosLockerAvosLockerhas used a variety of Windows API calls, includingNtCurrentPebandGetLogicalDrives.[26]S0638BabukBabukcan use multiple Windows API calls for actions on compromised hosts including discovery and execution.[27][28][29]S0475BackConfigBackConfigcan leverage API functions such asShellExecuteAandHttpOpenRequestAin the process of downloading and executing files.[30]S0606Bad RabbitBad Rabbithas used various Windows API calls.[31]S1081BADHATCHBADHATCHcan utilize Native API functions such as,ToolHelp32andRt1AdjustPrivilegeto enableSeDebugPrivilegeon a compromised machine.[32]S0128BADNEWSBADNEWShas a command to download an .exe and execute it via CreateProcess API.

Policies[211]where appropriate.[212]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes. Utilization of the Windows APIs may involve processes loading/accessing system DLLs associated with providing called functions (ex: ntdll.dll, kernel32.dll, advapi32.dll, user32.dll, and gdi32.dll). Monitoring for DLL loads, especially to abnormal/unusual or potentially malicious processes, may indicate abuse of the Windows API. Though noisy, this data can be combined with other indicators to identify adversary activity.DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitoring API calls may generate a significant amount of data and may not be useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances, since benign use of API functions are common and may be difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Correlation of other events with behavior surrounding API function calls using API monitoring will provide additional context to an event that may assist in determining if it is due to malicious behavior. Correlation of activity by process lineage by process ID may be sufficient.ReferencesThe NTinterlnals.net team. (n.d.). Nowak, T. Retrieved June 25, 2020.Linux Kernel Organization, Inc. (n.d.).
