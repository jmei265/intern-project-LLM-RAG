For example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding to bind a Role or ClusterRole to a Kubernetes account.[1][2]Where attribute-based access control (ABAC) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a Kubernetes ABAC policy to give the target account additional permissions.[3]This account modification may immediately followCreate Accountor other malicious account activity. Adversaries may also modify existingValid Accountsthat they have compromised.Note that where container orchestration systems are deployed in cloud environments, as with Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, and Azure Kubernetes Service, cloud-based  role-based access control (RBAC) assignments or ABAC policies can often be used in place of or in addition to local permission assignments.[4][5][6]In these cases, this technique may be used in conjunction withAdditional Cloud Roles.ID:T1098.006Sub-technique of:T1098ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:ContainersVersion:1.0Created:14 July 2023Last Modified:16 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationRequire multi-factor authentication for user accounts integrated into container clusters through cloud deployments or via authentication protocols such as LDAP or SAML.M1018User Account ManagementEnsure that low-privileged accounts do not have permissions to add permissions to accounts or to update container cluster roles.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0002User AccountUser Account ModificationCollect usage logs from accounts to identify unusual activity in the assignment of roles to those accounts.
