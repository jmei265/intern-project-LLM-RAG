Regsvcs and Regasm are Windows command-line utilities that are used to register .NETComponent Object Model(COM) assemblies. Both are binaries that may be digitally signed by Microsoft.[1][2]Both utilities may be used to bypass application control through use of attributes within the binary to specify code that should be run before registration or unregistration:[ComRegisterFunction]or[ComUnregisterFunction]respectively. The code with the registration and unregistration attributes will be executed even if the process is run under insufficient privileges and fails to execute.[3][4]ID:T1218.009Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Casey SmithVersion:2.0Created:23 January 2020Last Modified:11 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas dropped RegAsm.exe onto systems for performing malicious activity.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramRegsvcs and Regasm may not be necessary within a given environment.M1038Execution PreventionBlock execution of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe if they are not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand arguments used before and after Regsvcs.exe or Regasm.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe. Compare recent invocations of Regsvcs.exe and Regasm.exe with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.ReferencesMicrosoft.
