Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, packers, and C2 protocols. Adversaries may acquire malware to support their operations, obtaining a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.In addition to downloading free malware from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware development, criminal marketplaces (including Malware-as-a-Service, or MaaS), or from individuals. In addition to purchasing malware, adversaries may steal and repurpose malware from third-party entities (including other adversaries).ID:T1588.001Sub-technique of:T1588ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0138AndarielAndarielhas used a variety of publicly-available remote access Trojans (RATs) for its operations.[1]G0006APT1APT1used publicly available malware for privilege escalation.[2]G0143Aquatic PandaAquatic Pandahas acquired and usednjRATin its operations.[3]G0135BackdoorDiplomacyBackdoorDiplomacyhas obtained and used leaked malware, including DoublePulsar, EternalBlue, EternalRocks, and EternalSynergy, in its operations.[4]C0015C0015ForC0015, the threat actors usedCobalt StrikeandContiransomware.[5]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas acquired and used a variety of malware, includingCobalt Strike.[6]C0007FunnyDreamForFunnyDream, the threat actors used a new backdoor namedFunnyDream.[7]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$acquired and used the Redline password stealer in their operations.[8]G0140LazyScripterLazyScripterhas used a variety of open-source remote access Trojans for its operations.[9]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas obtained and used malware such asCobalt Strike.[10][11]G1013MetadorMetadorhas used unique malware in their operations, includingmetaMainandMafalda.[12]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors used Trojans from underground hacker websites.[13]C0005Operation SpalaxForOperation Spalax, the threat actors obtained malware, includingRemcos,njRAT, and AsyncRAT.[14]G1018TA2541TA2541has used multiple strains of malware available for purchase on criminal forums or in open-source repositories.[15]G0092TA505TA505has used malware such asAzorultandCobalt Strikein their operations.[16]G0010TurlaTurlahas used malware obtained after compromising other threat actors, such asOilRig.[17][18]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0004Malware RepositoryMalware ContentConsider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with malware providers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, code similarities, or even group identifiers associated with specific MaaS offerings. Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples associated with the developers and the adversary utilizing their services. Identifying overlaps in malware use by different adversaries may indicate malware was obtained by the adversary rather than developed by them. In some cases, identifying overlapping characteristics in malware used by different adversaries may point to a shared quartermaster.[19]Malware MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a malicious payload, such as compilation times, file hashes, as well as watermarks or other identifiable configuration information. Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on post-compromise phases of the adversary lifecycle.ReferencesFSI. (2017, July 27). Campaign Rifle - Andariel, the Maiden of Anguish.
