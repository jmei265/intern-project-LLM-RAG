Further,  adversaries may leverageData from Configuration Repositoryin order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.[1]Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.[2]The resulting plaintext password resulting from a successfully cracked hash may be used to log into systems, resources, and services in which the account has access.ID:T1110.002Sub-technique of:T1110ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Linux, Network, Office 365, Windows, macOSContributors:Mohamed KmalVersion:1.2Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3APT3has been known to brute force password hashes to be able to leverage plain text credentials.[3]G0096APT41APT41performed password brute-force attacks on the local admin account.[4]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas dropped and executed tools used for password cracking, including Hydra andCrackMapExec.[5][6]G0037FIN6FIN6has extracted password hashes from ntds.dit to crack offline.[7]S0056Net CrawlerNet Crawleruses a list of known credentials gathered through credential dumping to guess passwords to accounts as it spreads throughout a network.[8]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors used Cain & Abel to crack password hashes.[9]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication.

It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. Consider focusing efforts on detecting other adversary behavior used to acquire credential materials, such asOS Credential DumpingorKerberoasting.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network. (ex: Windows EID 4625 or 5379)ReferencesUS-CERT. (2018, April 20).
