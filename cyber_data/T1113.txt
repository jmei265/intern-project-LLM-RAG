Detection methods could include collecting information from unusual processes using API calls used to obtain image data, and monitoring for image files written to disk, such asCopyFromScreen,xwd, orscreencapture.[1][2]. The sensor data may need to be correlated with other events to identify malicious activity, depending on the legitimacy of this behavior within a given network environment.ReferencesMicrosoft.
