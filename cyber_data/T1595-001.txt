Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order toGather Victim Network Information, such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses. Scans may range from simple pings (ICMP requests and responses) to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts.[1]Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Develop CapabilitiesorObtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex:External Remote Services).ID:T1595.001Sub-technique of:T1595ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas scanned specific lists of target IP addresses.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
