A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.[1]Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems.[2]Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers.[3]With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scalePhishingor Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).ID:T1584.005Sub-technique of:T1584ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:19 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0001AxiomAxiomhas used large groups of compromised machines for use as proxy nodes.[4]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas used a large-scale botnet to target Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network devices.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as duringPhishing,Endpoint Denial of Service, orNetwork Denial of Service.ReferencesNorton. (n.d.).
