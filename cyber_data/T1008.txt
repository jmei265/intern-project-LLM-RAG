Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific protocol used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.[51]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that may use fallback or alternate communication channels if the primary channel is compromised or inaccessible in order to maintain reliable command and control and to avoid data transfer thresholds. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before may be suspicious.Note: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on TCP network connection creation.
