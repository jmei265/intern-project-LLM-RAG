If another certificate is presented, it could indicate device compromise, traffic interception, or another upstream issue. While benign usages are common, it is also possible for adversaries to abuse this technology to protect malicious C2 traffic.In normal, not pinned SSL validation, when a client connects to a server using HTTPS, it typically checks whether the server’s SSL/TLS certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) in the device’s trust store. If the certificate is valid and signed by a trusted CA, the connection is established. However, withSSL Pinning, the client is configured to trust a specific SSL/TLS certificate or public key, rather than relying on the device’s trust store. This means that even if the server’s certificate is signed by a trusted CA, the client will only establish the connection of the certificate or key is pinned.There are two types ofSSL Pinning:Certificate Pinning: The client stores a copy of the server’s certificate and compares it with the certificate received during the SSL handshake. If the certificates match, then the client proceeds with the connection. This approach also works with self-signed certificates.Public Key Pinning: Instead of pinning the entire certificate, the client pins just the public key extracted from the certificate. This is often more flexible, as it allows the server to renew its certificate without having to update the pinned certificate or breaking the SSL connection.ID:T1521.003Sub-technique of:T1521Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSContributors:Manikantan Srinivasan, NEC Corporation India; Pooja Natarajan, NEC Corporation India; Takahashi Wataru, NEC CorporationVersion:1.0Created:29 March 2024Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0507eSurveSurv’s Android version has used certificate pinning for C2 communication.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1012Enterprise PolicyCertain enterprise policies can be applied to prevent users from adding certificates to the device and to prevent applications from being able to install their own certificates.M1011User GuidanceUsers should be advised to not trust or install self-signed certificates.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingApplication AssetsApplication vetting services can detect certificate pinning by examining an application’snetwork_security_config.xmlfile, although this behavior can be benign.ReferencesA.
