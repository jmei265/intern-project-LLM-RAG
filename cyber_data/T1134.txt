Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e.Token Impersonation/Theft) or used to spawn a new process (i.e.Create Process with Token). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.[1]Any standard user can use therunascommand, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.ID:T1134Sub-techniques:T1134.001,T1134.002,T1134.003,T1134.004,T1134.005ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserⓘEffective Permissions:SYSTEMⓘDefense Bypassed:Heuristic Detection, Host Forensic Analysis, System Access Controls, Windows User Account ControlContributors:Jared Atkinson, @jaredcatkinson; Robby Winchester, @robwinchester3; Tom Ueltschi @c_APT_ure; Travis Smith, TripwireVersion:2.0Created:14 December 2017Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0622AppleSeedAppleSeedcan gain system level privilege by passingSeDebugPrivilegeto theAdjustTokenPrivilegeAPI.[2]S1068BlackCatBlackCathas the ability modify access tokens.[3][4]G0108Blue MockingbirdBlue Mockingbirdhas used JuicyPotato to abuse theSeImpersonatetoken privilege to escalate from web application pool accounts to NT Authority\SYSTEM.[5]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41used a ConfuserEx obfuscated BADPOTATO exploit to abuse named-pipe impersonation for localNT AUTHORITY\SYSTEMprivilege escalation.[6]S0625CubaCubahas usedSeDebugPrivilegeandAdjustTokenPrivilegesto elevate privileges.[7]S0038DuquDuquexamines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.

Specifically, analysts should look for use of therunascommand. Detailed command-line logging is not enabled by default in Windows.[29]DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls, loaded by a payload, for token manipulation only through careful analysis of user network activity, examination of running processes, and correlation with other endpoint and network behavior. There are many Windows API calls a payload can take advantage of to manipulate access tokens (e.g.,LogonUser[30],DuplicateTokenEx[31], andImpersonateLoggedOnUser[32]). Please see the referenced Windows API pages for more information.Process CreationMonitor for executed processes that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.Process MetadataQuery systems for process and thread token information and look for inconsistencies such as user owns processes impersonating the local SYSTEM account.[33]Look for inconsistencies between the various fields that store PPID information, such as the EventHeader ProcessId from data collected via Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), Creator Process ID/Name from Windows event logs, and the ProcessID and ParentProcessID (which are also produced from ETW and other utilities such as Task Manager and Process Explorer). The ETW provided EventHeader ProcessId identifies the actual parent process.DS0002User AccountUser Account MetadataMonitor for contextual data about an account, which may include a username, user ID, environmental data, etc. that may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.ReferencesnetbiosX.
