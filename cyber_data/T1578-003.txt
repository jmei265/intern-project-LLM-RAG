Deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.An adversary may alsoCreate Cloud Instanceand later terminate the instance after achieving their objectives.[1]ID:T1578.003Sub-technique of:T1578ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:IaaSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.1Created:16 June 2020Last Modified:08 March 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has deleted the target's systems and resources in the cloud to trigger the organization's incident and crisis response process.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditRoutinely check user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to delete new instances.M1018User Account ManagementLimit permissions for deleting new instances in accordance with least privilege. Organizations should limit the number of users within the organization with an IAM role that has administrative privileges, strive to reduce all permanent privileged role assignments, and conduct periodic entitlement reviews on IAM users, roles and policies.[1]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0030InstanceInstance DeletionThe deletion of a new instance or virtual machine is a common part of operations within many cloud environments. Events should then not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities. For example, detecting a sequence of events such as the creation of an instance, mounting of a snapshot to that instance, and deletion of that instance by a new user account may indicate suspicious activity.In AWS, CloudTrail logs capture the deletion of an instance in the TerminateInstances event, and in Azure the deletion of a VM may be captured in Azure activity logs.[3][4]Google's Admin Activity audit logs within their Cloud Audit logs can be used to detect the usage of gcloud compute instances delete to delete a VM.[5]Instance MetadataPeriodically baseline instances to identify malicious modifications or additions.ReferencesMandiant.
