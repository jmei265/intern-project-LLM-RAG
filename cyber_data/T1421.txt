On Android, this can be done by querying the respective APIs:WifiInfofor information about the current Wi-Fi connection, as well as nearby Wi-Fi networks. Querying theWiFiInfoAPI requires the application to hold theACCESS_FINE_LOCATIONpermission.BluetoothAdapterfor information about Bluetooth devices, which also requires the application to hold several permissions granted by the user at runtime.For Android versions prior to Q, applications can use theTelephonyManager.getNeighboringCellInfo()method. For Q and later, applications can use theTelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()method. Both methods require the application hold theACCESS_FINE_LOCATIONpermission.ID:T1421Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:AndroidVersion:2.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:31 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto collect information regarding available Wi-Fi networks.[1]S0405ExodusExodusTwo collects a list of nearby base stations.[2]S0509FakeSpyFakeSpycan collect the device’s network information.[3]S0408FlexiSpyFlexiSpycan collect a list of known Wi-Fi access points.[4]S0407MonokleMonoklecan retrieve nearby cell tower and Wi-Fi network information.[5]S0399PallasPallasgathers and exfiltrates data about nearby Wi-Fi access points.[6]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOSmonitors the connection state and tracks which types of networks the phone is connected to, potentially to determine the bandwidth and ability to send full data across the network.[7]S0506ViperRATViperRATcan collect the device’s cell tower information.[8]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
