This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.Adversaries may also use the same icon of the file they are trying to mimic.ID:T1036.005Sub-technique of:T1036ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Containers, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Application ControlContributors:Vishwas Manral, McAfee;

Looks for mismatches between process names and their image paths.Malware authors often use this technique to hide malicious executables behind legitimate Windows executable names (e.g. lsass.exe, svchost.exe, etc).There are several sub-techniques, but this analytic focuses onMatch Legitimate Name or Locationonly.Note: With process monitoring, hunt for processes matching these criteria:process name is svchost.exe, smss.exe, wininit.exe, taskhost.exe, etc.process path is not C:\Windows\System32\ or C:\Windows\SysWow64\Examples (true positive):C:\Users\administrator\svchost.exeTo make sure the rule doesn’t miss cases where the executable would be started from a sub-folder of these locations, the entire path is checked for the process path. The below example should be considered as suspicious: C:\Windows\System32\srv\svchost.exeAnalytic 1 - Common Windows Process Masquerading(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688")AND ( (Image=svchost.exe AND (image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe" OR process_path!="C:\Windows\SysWow64\svchost.exe"))  OR (Image="*smss.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\smss.exe")  OR (Image="wininit.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\wininit.exe")  OR (Image="taskhost.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\taskhost.exe")  OR (Image="lasass.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\lsass.exe")  OR (Image="winlogon.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\winlogon.exe")  OR (Image="csrss.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\csrss.exe")  OR (Image="services.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\services.exe")  OR (Image="lsm.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\System32\lsm.exe")  OR (Image="explorer.exe" AND image_path!="C:\Windows\explorer.exe")Process MetadataCollecting and comparing disk and resource filenames for binaries by looking to see if the InternalName, OriginalFilename, and/or ProductName match what is expected could provide useful leads, but may not always be indicative of malicious activity.ReferencesDragos Inc..
