Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.For example, in Azure AD, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment status, and use of multi-factor authentication.[1][2][3]In some cases, identity providers may also support the use of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In AWS and GCP, IAM policies can containconditionattributes that verify arbitrary constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the nature of the resources or regions being requested.[4][5]These measures help to prevent compromised credentials from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit user permissions to only those required.By modifying conditional access policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removingMulti-Factor Authenticationrequirements, or allowing additionalUnused/Unsupported Cloud Regions, adversaries may be able to ensure persistent access to accounts and circumvent defensive measures.ID:T1556.009Sub-technique of:T1556ⓘTactics:Credential Access,Defense Evasion,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, IaaS, SaaSContributors:Gavin Knapp; Joshua PennyVersion:1.0Created:02 January 2024Last Modified:18 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderhas added additional trusted locations to Azure AD conditional access policies.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementLimit permissions to modify conditional access policies to only those required.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0026Active DirectoryActive Directory Object ModificationMonitor for changes made to security settings related to Azure AD Conditional Access Policies.
