Information about victims may be available in various online sites, such as social media, new sites, or those hosting information about business operations such as hiring or requested/rewarded contracts.[1][2][3]Adversaries may search in different online sites depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Phishing for InformationorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Establish AccountsorCompromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:External Remote ServicesorPhishing).ID:T1593Sub-techniques:T1593.001,T1593.002,T1593.003ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:18 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamresearched Ukraine's unique legal entity identifier (called an "EDRPOU" number), including running queries on the EDRPOU website, in preparation for theNotPetyaattack.Sandworm Teamhas also researched third-party websites to help it craft credible spearphishing emails.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1013Application Developer GuidanceApplication developers uploading to public code repositories should be careful to avoid publishing sensitive information such as credentials and API keys.M1047AuditScan public code repositories for exposed credentials or other sensitive information before making commits. Ensure that any leaked credentials are removed from the commit history, not just the current latest version of the code.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesCyware Hacker News.
