Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.ID:T1481.002Sub-technique of:T1481Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.2Created:06 April 2022Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan be controlled via IRC using freenode.net servers.[1]S0485MandrakeMandrakehas used Firebase for C2.[2]S0545TERRACOTTATERRACOTTAhas used Firebase for C2 communication.[3]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
