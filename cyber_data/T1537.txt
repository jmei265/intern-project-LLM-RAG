Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.[1]Adversaries may also use cloud-native mechanisms to share victim data with adversary-controlled cloud accounts, such as creating anonymous file sharing links or, in Azure, a shared access signature (SAS) URI.[2]Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.[3]ID:T1537Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:Darin Smith, Cisco; ExtraHop; Gabriel Currie; PraetorianVersion:1.4Created:30 August 2019Last Modified:11 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1057Data Loss PreventionData loss prevention can prevent and block sensitive data from being shared with individuals outside an organization.[4][5]M1037Filter Network TrafficImplement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs.M1054Software ConfigurationConfigure appropriate data sharing restrictions in cloud services. For example, external sharing in Microsoft SharePoint and Google Drive can be turned off altogether, blocked for certain domains, or restricted to certain users.[6][7]M1018User Account ManagementLimit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor logs for SaaS applications to detect instances of data being shared inappropriately. For example, in Microsoft 365, file sharing events will appear in Audit logs under the event namesSharingInvitationCreated,AnonymousLinkCreated,SecureLinkCreated, orAddedToSecureLink, withTargetUserOrGroupTypebeingGuest.[8]In Google Workspace, externally shared files will have aVisibilityproperty ofShared externallyin the Drive audit logs.[9]DS0010Cloud StorageCloud Storage CreationMonitor account activity for attempts to create and share data, such as snapshots or backups, with untrusted or unusual accounts.Cloud Storage MetadataPeriodically baseline cloud storage infrastructure to identify malicious modifications or additions.Cloud Storage ModificationMonitor for anomalous file transfer activity between accounts and/or to untrusted/unexpected VPCs.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor network traffic content for evidence of data exfiltration, such as gratuitous or anomalous internal traffic containing collected data.
