Adversaries can use compromised email accounts to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conductPhishing for Information,Phishing, or large-scale spam email campaigns. Utilizing an existing persona with a compromised email account may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship with, or knowledge of, the compromised persona. Compromised email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex:Domains).A variety of methods exist for compromising email accounts, such as gathering credentials viaPhishing for Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps), or paying employees, suppliers or business partners for access to credentials.[1][2]Prior to compromising email accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation. Adversaries may target compromising well-known email accounts or domains from which malicious spam orPhishingemails may evade reputation-based email filtering rules.Adversaries can use a compromised email account to hijack existing email threads with targets of interest.ID:T1586.002Sub-technique of:T1586ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Bryan Onel; Tristan Bennett, Seamless IntelligenceVersion:1.1Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:11 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used compromised email accounts to send credential phishing emails.[3]G0016APT29APT29has compromised email accounts to further enable phishing campaigns and taken control of dormant accounts.[4][5]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used compromised accounts to send spearphishing emails.[6]G0136IndigoZebraIndigoZebrahas compromised legitimate email accounts to use in their spearphishing operations.[7]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas compromised email accounts to send spearphishing e-mails.[8][9]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has payed employees, suppliers, and business partners of target organizations for credentials.[10][11]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas compromised email accounts to conduct social engineering attacks.[12]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas compromised personal email accounts through the use of legitimate credentials and gathered additional victim information.[13]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex:Phishing).ReferencesBright, P. (2011, February 15).
