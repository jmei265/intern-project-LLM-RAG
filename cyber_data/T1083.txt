Adversaries may use the information fromFile and Directory Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Many command shell utilities can be used to obtain this information. Examples includedir,tree,ls,find, andlocate.[1]Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with theNative API. Adversaries may also leverage aNetwork Device CLIon network devices to gather file and directory information (e.g.dir,show flash, and/ornvram).[2]Some files and directories may require elevated or specific user permissions to access.ID:T1083Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defenseVersion:1.6Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS00663PARA RAT3PARA RAThas a command to retrieve metadata for files on disk as well as a command to list the current working directory.[3]S00654H RAT4H RAThas the capability to obtain file and directory listings.[3]S1125AcidRainAcidRainidentifies specific files and directories in the Linux operating system associated with storage devices.[4]S1028Action RATAction RAThas the ability to collect drive and file information on an infected machine.[5]G0018admin@338admin@338actors used the following commands after exploiting a machine withLOWBALLmalware to obtain information about files and directories:dir c:\ >> %temp%\downloaddir "c:\Documents and Settings" >> %temp%\downloaddir "c:\Program Files\" >> %temp%\downloaddir d:\ >> %temp%\download[6]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLcan list files and directories.[7][8]S1129AkiraAkiraexamines files prior to encryption to determine if they meet requirements for encryption and can be encrypted by the ransomware.
