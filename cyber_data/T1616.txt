This could be used for adversary goals such as audio surveillance, blocking or forwarding calls from the device owner, or C2 communication.Several permissions may be used to programmatically control phone calls, including:ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS- Allows the application to answer incoming phone calls[1]CALL_PHONE- Allows the application to initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer interface[1]PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS- Allows the application to see the number being dialed during an outgoing call with the option to redirect the call to a different number or abort the call altogether[1]MANAGE_OWN_CALLS- Allows a calling application which manages its own calls through the self-managedConnectionServiceAPIs[1]BIND_TELECOM_CONNECTION_SERVICE- Required permission when using aConnectionService[1]WRITE_CALL_LOG- Allows an application to write to the device call log, potentially to hide malicious phone calls[1]When granted some of these permissions, an application can make a phone call without opening the dialer first. However, if an application desires to simply redirect the user to the dialer with a phone number filled in, it can launch an Intent usingIntent.ACTION_DIAL, which requires no specific permissions. This then requires the user to explicitly initiate the call or use some form ofInput Injectionto programmatically initiate it.ID:T1616Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Collection,Impact,Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:AndroidⓘMTC ID:APP-41,CEL-42,CEL-36,CEL-18Contributors:Gaetan van Diemen, ThreatFabricVersion:1.2Created:20 September 2021Last Modified:10 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0292AndroRATAndroRATcan make phone calls.[2]S0422AnubisAnubiscan make phone calls.[3]S1094BRATABRATAcan hide incoming calls by setting ring volume to 0 and showing a blank screen overlay.[4]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan open a hidden menu when a specific phone number is called from the infected device.[5]S0529CarbonStealCarbonStealcan silently accept an incoming phone call.[6]S1054DrinikDrinikcan use the AndroidCallScreeningServiceto silently block incoming calls.[7]S1092EscobarEscobarcan initiate phone calls.[8]S1080FakecallsFakecallscan intercept and imitate phone conversations by breaking the connection and displaying a fake call screen.
