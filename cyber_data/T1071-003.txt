Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.Protocols such as SMTP/S, POP3/S, and IMAP that carry electronic mail may be very common in environments.  Packets produced from these protocols may have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. Data could also be concealed within the email messages themselves. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic.[1]ID:T1071.003Sub-technique of:T1071ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas used SMTP for C2 communications.[2][3][4]G0007APT28APT28has used IMAP, POP3, and SMTP for a communication channel in various implants, including using self-registered Google Mail accounts and later compromised email servers of its victims.[1][5]G0050APT32APT32has used email for C2 via an Office macro.[6][7]S0337BadPatchBadPatchuses SMTP for C2.[8]S0351CannonCannonuses SMTP/S and POP3/S for C2 communications by sending and receiving emails.[9]S0023CHOPSTICKVarious implementations ofCHOPSTICKcommunicate with C2 over SMTP and POP3.[10]S0126ComRATComRATcan use email attachments for command and control.[11]S0137CORESHELLCORESHELLcan communicate over SMTP and POP3 for C2.[1][12]S0477GoopyGoopyhas the ability to use a Microsoft Outlook backdoor macro to communicate with its C2.[7]S0201JPINJPINcan send email over SMTP.[13]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used e-mail to send exfiltrated data to C2 servers.[14]S0395LightNeuronLightNeuronuses SMTP for C2.[15]S0247NavRATNavRATuses the email platform, Naver, for C2 communications, leveraging SMTP.[16]S1090NightClubNightClubcan use emails for C2 communications.[17]S0138OLDBAITOLDBAITcan use SMTP for C2.[1]S0495RDATRDATcan use email attachments for C2 communications.[18]S0125RemsecRemsecis capable of using SMTP for C2.[19][20][21][22]G0083SilverTerrierSilverTerrieruses SMTP for C2 communications.[23]S1042SUGARDUMPASUGARDUMPvariant used SMTP for C2.[24]G0010TurlaTurlahas used multiple backdoors which communicate with a C2 server via email attachments.[25]S0022UroburosUroburoscan use custom communications protocols that ride over SMTP.[26]S0251ZebrocyZebrocyuses SMTP and POP3 for C2.[27][9][28][29][30]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
