Some of the information may help adversaries to further their operation within a network. Adversaries may use the information fromQuery Registryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific

The New-PSDrive PowerShell cmdlet creates temporary and persistent drives that are mapped to or associated with a location in a data store, such a registry key (PSProvider "Registry"). The the Get-ChildItem gets the items in one or more specified locations. By using both, you can enumerate COM objects in one or more specified locations.Analytic 1 - Suspicious Commands(source="*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational" EventCode="4103") | WHERE CommandLine LIKE "%New-PSDrive%" AND (CommandLine LIKE "%Registry%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT%" OR CommandLine LIKE "%HKCR%")DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls (such asRegOpenKeyExA) that may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software. OS API calls associated with querying the Windows Registry are RegOpenKeyEx , RegOpenUserClassesRoot, RegQueryValueExA, and RegQueryValueExW. Execution of these functions might trigger security log ids such as 4663 (Microsoft Security Auditing). Also monitor for RegOpenUserClassesRoot api to retrieve a handle to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key for a specified user. The returned key has a view of the registry that merges the contents of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key with the contents of the Software\Classes keys in the user's registry hive.Note: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls.Process CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.Note: The New-PSDrive PowerShell cmdlet creates temporary and persistent drives that are mapped to or associated with a location in a data store, such a registry key (PSProvider "Registry"). The Get-ChildItem gets the items in one or more specified locations. By using both, you can enumerate COM objects in one or more specified locations.Note for Analytic 3: Replace FilePathToLolbasProcessXX.exe with lolBAS process names that are used by your organization. The number_standard_deviations parameter should be tuned accordingly. Identifying outliers by comparing distance from a data point to the average value against a certain number of standard deviations is recommended for data values that are symmetrical distributed.

Depending on the Registry key you are monitoring, the implementation of a new System Access Control List (SACL) might be required. Depending of Registry key used for the creation of a System Access Control List (SACL), the generation of event ids 4656 and 4663 might be noisy.Analytic 1 - Suspicious Registry(source="*WinEventLog:Security" EventCode IN (4663, 4656)) AND ObjectType="Key" | WHERE ObjectName LIKE "%SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall%" AND (UserAccessList LIKE "%4435%" OR UserAccessList LIKE "%Enumerate sub-keys%" OR UserAccessList LIKE "%4432%" OR UserAccessList LIKE "%Query key value%") AND Image NOT IN ('FilePathToExpectedProcess01.exe','FilePathToExpectedProcess02.exe')ReferencesWikipedia.
