SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs is a Visual Basic script associated with how Windows virtualizes applications (Microsoft Application Virtualization, or App-V).[1]For example, Windows may render Win32 applications to users as virtual applications, allowing users to launch and interact with them as if they were installed locally.[2][3]The SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs script is legitimate, may be signed by Microsoft, and is commonly executed from\System32through the command line viawscript.exe.[4][5]Adversaries may abuse SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs to bypassPowerShellexecution restrictions and evade defensive counter measures by "living off the land."[6][4]Proxying execution may function as a trusted/signed alternative to directly invokingpowershell.exe.[7]For example,PowerShellcommands may be invoked using:[5]SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs "n; {PowerShell}"ID:T1216.002Sub-technique of:T1216ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsContributors:Shaul Vilkomir-PreismanVersion:1.0Created:06 February 2024Last Modified:18 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionCertain signed scripts that can be used to execute other programs may not be necessary within a given environment.

If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.ReferencesSEONGSU PARK. (2022, December 27). BlueNoroff introduces new methods bypassing MoTW.
