By utilizing a proxy, adversaries hide the true IP address of their C2 server and associated infrastructure from the destination of the network traffic. This masquerades an adversary’s traffic as legitimate traffic originating from the compromised device, which can evade IP-based restrictions and alerts on certain services, such as bank accounts and social media websites.[1]The most common type of proxy is a SOCKS proxy. It can typically be implemented using standard OS-level APIs and 3rd party libraries with no indication to the user. On Android, adversaries can use theProxyAPI to programmatically establish a SOCKS proxy connection, or lower-level APIs to interact directly with raw sockets.ID:T1604Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:AndroidVersion:1.1Created:30 November 2020Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0522ExobotExobotcan open a SOCKS proxy connection through the compromised device.[1]S1067FluBotFluBotcan use a SOCKS proxy to evade C2 IP detection.[2]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
