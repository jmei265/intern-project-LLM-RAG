Credentials targeted byPinchDukeinclude ones associated many sources such as WinInet Credential Cache, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).[12]G0033Poseidon GroupPoseidon Groupconducts credential dumping on victims, with a focus on obtaining credentials belonging to domain and database servers.[13]S0379Revenge RATRevenge RAThas a plugin for credential harvesting.[14]G0054SowbugSowbughas used credential dumping tools.[15]G0039SuckflySuckflyused a signed credential-dumping tool to obtain victim account credentials.[16]G0131Tonto TeamTonto Teamhas used a variety of credential dumping tools.[17]S0094Trojan.KaraganyTrojan.Karaganycan dump passwords and save them into\ProgramData\Mail\MailAg\pwds.txt.[18]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1015Active Directory ConfigurationManage the access control list for "Replicating Directory Changes" and other permissions associated with domain controller replication.[19][20]Consider adding users to the "Protected Users" Active Directory security group. This can help limit the caching of users' plaintext credentials.[21]M1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to secure LSASS and prevent credential stealing.[22]M1043Credential Access ProtectionWith Windows 10, Microsoft implemented new protections called Credential Guard to protect the LSA secrets that can be used to obtain credentials through forms of credential dumping. It is not configured by default and has hardware and firmware system requirements.[23]It also does not protect against all forms of credential dumping.[24]M1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnsure Domain Controller backups are properly secured.M1028Operating System ConfigurationConsider disabling or restricting NTLM.[25]Consider disabling WDigest authentication.[26]M1027Password PoliciesEnsure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.M1026Privileged Account ManagementWindows:Do not put user or admin domain accounts in the local administrator groups across systems unless they are tightly controlled, as this is often equivalent to having a local administrator account with the same password on all systems. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.[27]Linux:Scraping the passwords from memory requires root privileges. Follow best practices in restricting access to privileged accounts to avoid hostile programs from accessing such sensitive regions of memory.M1025Privileged Process IntegrityOn Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, enable Protected Process Light for LSA.[28]M1017User TrainingLimit credential overlap across accounts and systems by training users and administrators not to use the same password for multiple accounts.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0026Active DirectoryActive Directory Object AccessMonitor domain controller logs for replication requests and other unscheduled activity possibly associated with DCSync.[29][30][31]Note: Domain controllers may not log replication requests originating from the default domain controller account.[32].

Look for command-lines that invoke AuditD or the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). Remote access tools may contain built-in features or incorporate existing tools likeMimikatz.PowerShellscripts also exist that contain credential dumping functionality, such as PowerSploit's Invoke-Mimikatz module,[34]which may require additional logging features to be configured in the operating system to collect necessary information for analysis.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for hash dumpers opening the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on the local file system (%SystemRoot%/system32/config/SAM). Some hash dumpers will open the local file system as a device and parse to the SAM table to avoid file access defenses. Others will make an in-memory copy of the SAM table before reading hashes. Detection of compromised ( LinkById: T1078) in-use by adversaries may help as well.File CreationMonitor for the unexpected creation of memory dump files (e.g.,lsass{*}.dmp) for processes that may contain credentials, such as LSASS.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software.Process AccessMonitor for unexpected processes interacting with lsass.exe.[35]Common credential dumpers such asMimikatzaccess the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) process by opening the process, locating the LSA secrets key, and decrypting the sections in memory where credential details are stored. Credential dumpers may also use methods for reflectiveProcess Injectionto reduce potential indicators of malicious activity.LinuxTo obtain the passwords and hashes stored in memory, processes must open a maps file in the /proc filesystem for the process being analyzed. This file is stored under the path/proc/<pid>/maps, where the<pid>directory is the unique pid of the program being interrogated for such authentication data. The AuditD monitoring tool, which ships stock in many Linux distributions, can be used to watch for hostile processes opening this file in the proc file system, alerting on the pid, process name, and arguments of such programs.Process CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may be indicative of credential dumping. On Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2, monitor Windows Logs for LSASS.exe creation to verify that LSASS started as a protected process.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key AccessMonitor for the SAM registry key being accessed that may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software.ReferencesTim Wadhwa-Brown.
