Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.[1]Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.[2][3]Adversaries may extract credentials from memory viaExploitation for Credential Access.[4]Adversaries may also try brute forcing viaPassword Guessingto obtain the master password of a password manager.[5]ID:T1555.005Sub-technique of:T1555ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:Matt Burrough, @mattburrough, MicrosoftVersion:1.0Created:22 January 2021Last Modified:25 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas used scripts to access credential information from the KeePass database.[6]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has accessed local password managers and databases to obtain further credentials from a compromised network.[7]S0652MarkiRATMarkiRATcan gather information from the Keepass password manager.[8]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors accessed and collected credentials from password managers.[2]S0279ProtonProtongathers credentials in files for 1password.[9]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390obtained a KeePass database from a compromised host.[10]S0266TrickBotTrickBotcan steal passwords from the KeePass open source password manager.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies for master passwords.[11]M1054Software ConfigurationConsider re-locking password managers after a short timeout to limit the time plaintext credentials live in memory from decrypted databases.M1051Update SoftwareUpdate password managers regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and servers.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.[1]DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor file reads that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.[1]DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.Process AccessMonitor process being accessed that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.[1]Referencesise.
