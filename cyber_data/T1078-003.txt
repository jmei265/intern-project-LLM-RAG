Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.Local Accounts may also be abused to elevate privileges and harvest credentials throughOS Credential Dumping. Password reuse may allow the abuse of local accounts across a set of machines on a network for the purposes of Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement.ID:T1078.003Sub-technique of:T1078ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Containers, Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserVersion:1.4Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:14 July 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29targets dormant or inactive user accounts, accounts belonging to individuals no longer at the organization but whose accounts remain on the system, for access and persistence.[1]G0050APT32APT32has used legitimate local admin account credentials.[2]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan use known credentials to run commands and spawn processes as a local user account.[3][4]S0367EmotetEmotetcan brute force a local admin password, then use it to facilitate lateral movement.[5]G0051FIN10FIN10has moved laterally using the Local Administrator account.[6]G0046FIN7FIN7has used compromised credentials for access as SYSTEM on Exchange servers.[7]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas used the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account to create files on Exchange servers.[8]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used a tool called GREASE to add a Windows admin account in order to allow them continued access via RDP.[9]S0368NotPetyaNotPetyacan use valid credentials withPsExecorwmicto spread itself to remote systems.[10][11]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors used local account credentials found during the intrusion for lateral movement and privilege escalation.[12]G0056PROMETHIUMPROMETHIUMhas created admin accounts on a compromised host.[13]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used compromised local accounts to access victims' networks.[14]G0081Tropic TrooperTropic Trooperhas used known administrator account credentials to execute the backdoor directly.[15]G0010TurlaTurlahas abused local accounts that have the same password across the victim’s network.[16]S0221UmbreonUmbreoncreates valid local users to provide access to the system.[17]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1027Password PoliciesEnsure that local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords across all systems on the network.M1026Privileged Account ManagementAudit local accounts permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account.[18][19]Limit the usage of local administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries.For example, audit the use of service accounts in Kubernetes, and avoid automatically granting them access to the Kubernetes API if this is not required.[20]Implementing LAPS may also help prevent reuse of local administrator credentials across a domain.[21]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.A remote desktop logon, throughRemote Desktop Protocol, may be typical of a system administrator or IT support, but only from select workstations. Monitoring remote desktop logons and comparing to known/approved originating systems can detect lateral movement of an adversary.Multiple users logged into a single machine at the same time, or even within the same hour, do not typically occur in networks we have observed.Logon events are Windows Event Code 4624 for Windows Vista and above, 518 for pre-Vista. Logoff events are 4634 for Windows Vista and above, 538 for pre-Vista. Logon types 2, 3, 9 and 10 are of interest.
