An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials) or to gain execution, as inMalicious Link. Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser. Prior to a phish for information (as inSpearphishing Link) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as inSpearphishing Link), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link.Typically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page that may include some client-side script such asJavaScriptto decide what content to serve to the user. Adversaries may clone legitimate sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest credentials duringSpearphishing Link.[1][2]Adversaries may alsoUpload Malwareand have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure (Domains) to help facilitateMalicious Link.Links can be written by adversaries to mask the true destination in order to deceive victims by abusing the URL schema and increasing the effectiveness of phishing.[3][4]Adversaries may also use free or paid accounts on link shortening services and Platform-as-a-Service providers to host link targets while taking advantage of the widely trusted domains of those providers to avoid being blocked while redirecting victims to malicious pages.[5][6][7][8]In addition, adversaries may serve a variety of malicious links through uniquely generated URIs/URLs (including one-time, single use links).[9][10][11][12]Finally, adversaries may take advantage of the decentralized nature of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to host link targets that are difficult to remove.[13]ID:T1608.005Sub-technique of:T1608ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Diyar Saadi Ali; Goldstein Menachem; Hen Porcilan; Nikola KovacVersion:1.4Created:17 March 2021Last Modified:28 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas created a link to a Dropbox file that has been used in their spear-phishing operations.[14]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas cloned victim organization login pages and staged them for later use in credential harvesting campaigns.Silent Librarianhas also made use of a variety of URL shorteners for these staged websites.[15][1][2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in malicious web content have been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged web content to make it accessible for targeting.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as duringSpearphishing Link,Spearphishing Link, orMalicious Link.ReferencesMalwarebytes Threat Intelligence Team.
