Information about an organization may include a variety of details, including the names of divisions/departments, specifics of business operations, as well as the roles and responsibilities of key employees.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation viaPhishing for Information. Information about an organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites).[1][2]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Phishing for InformationorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Establish AccountsorCompromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:PhishingorTrusted Relationship).ID:T1591Sub-techniques:T1591.001,T1591.002,T1591.003,T1591.004ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:27 August 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0094KimsukyKimsukyhas collected victim organization information including but not limited to organization hierarchy, functions, press releases, and others.[3]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas studied publicly available information about a targeted organization to tailor spearphishing efforts against specific departments and/or individuals.[4]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupgathered victim organization information to identify specific targets.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesSeals, T.
