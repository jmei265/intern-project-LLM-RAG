PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system.[1]Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include theStart-Processcmdlet which can be used to run an executable and theInvoke-Commandcmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk.A number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, includingEmpire,PowerSploit,PoshC2, and PSAttack.[2]PowerShell commands/scripts can also be executed without directly invoking thepowershell.exebinary through interfaces to PowerShell's underlyingSystem.Management.Automationassembly DLL exposed through the .NET framework and Windows Common Language Interface (CLI).[3][4][5]ID:T1059.001Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; Praetorian; Ross BrittainVersion:1.4Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused PowerShell scripts to run a credential harvesting tool in memory to evade defenses.[6]C00342022 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamutilized a PowerShell utility called TANKTRAP to spread and launch a wiper using Windows Group Policy.[7]S0677AADInternalsAADInternalsis written and executed via PowerShell.[8]S1129AkiraAkirawill execute PowerShell commands to delete system volume shadow copies.[9]S0622AppleSeedAppleSeedhas the ability to execute its payload via PowerShell.[10]G0073APT19APT19used PowerShell commands to execute payloads.[11]G0007APT28APT28downloads and executes PowerShell scripts and performs PowerShell commands.[12][13][14]G0016APT29APT29has used encoded PowerShell scripts uploaded toCozyCarinstallations to download and installSeaDuke.[15][16][17][18]G0022APT3APT3has used PowerShell on victim systems to download and run payloads after exploitation.[19]G0050APT32APT32has used PowerShell-based tools, PowerShell one-liners, and shellcode loaders for execution.[20][21][22]G0064APT33APT33has utilized PowerShell to download files from the C2 server and run various scripts.[23][24]G0082APT38APT38has used PowerShell to execute commands and other operational tasks.[25]G0087APT39APT39has used PowerShell to execute malicious code.[26][27]G0096APT41APT41leveraged PowerShell to deploy malware families in victims’ environments.[28][29]G1023APT5APT5has used PowerShell to accomplish tasks within targeted environments.[30]G0143Aquatic PandaAquatic Pandahas downloaded additional scripts and executed Base64 encoded commands in PowerShell.[31]S0129AutoIt backdoorAutoIt backdoordownloads a PowerShell script that decodes to a typical shellcode loader.[32]S1081BADHATCHBADHATCHcan utilizepowershell.exeto execute commands on a compromised host.[33][34]S0234BandookBandookhas used PowerShell loaders as part of execution.[35]S0534BazarBazarcan execute a PowerShell script received from C2.[36][37]S1070Black BastaBlack Bastahas used PowerShell scripts for discovery and to execute files over the network.[38][39][40]S0521BloodHoundBloodHoundcan use PowerShell to pull Active Directory information from the target environment.[41]G0108Blue MockingbirdBlue Mockingbirdhas used PowerShell reverse TCP shells to issue interactive commands over a network connection.[42]S0360BONDUPDATERBONDUPDATERis written in PowerShell.[43][44]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas used PowerShell for execution.[45]S1039BumblebeeBumblebeecan use PowerShell for execution.[46]C0018C0018DuringC0018, the threat actors used encoded PowerShell scripts for execution.[47][48]C0021C0021DuringC0021, the threat actors used obfuscated PowerShell to extract an encoded payload from within an .LNK file.[49][50]C0032C0032During theC0032campaign,TEMP.Velesused PowerShell to perform timestomping.[51]S0674CharmPowerCharmPowercan use PowerShell for payload execution and C2 communication.[52]G0114ChimeraChimerahas used PowerShell scripts to execute malicious payloads and the DSInternals PowerShell module to make use of Active Directory features.[53][54]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas used PowerShell to communicate with C2, download files, and execute reconnaissance commands.[55]S0660ClamblingTheClamblingdropper can use PowerShell to download the malware.[56]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas used powershell.exe to download and execute scripts.[57][58][59][60][61][62]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan execute a payload on a remote host with PowerShell.

only signed scripts.M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramIt may be possible to remove PowerShell from systems when not needed, but a review should be performed to assess the impact to an environment, since it could be in use for many legitimate purposes and administrative functions.Disable/restrict the WinRM Service to help prevent uses of PowerShell for remote execution.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control where appropriate. PowerShell Constrained Language mode can be used to restrict access to sensitive or otherwise dangerous language elements such as those used to execute arbitrary Windows APIs or files (e.g.,Add-Type).[270]M1026Privileged Account ManagementWhen PowerShell is necessary, consider restricting PowerShell execution policy to administrators. Be aware that there are methods of bypassing the PowerShell execution policy, depending on environment configuration.[271]PowerShell JEA (Just Enough Administration) may also be used to sandbox administration and limit what commands admins/users can execute through remote PowerShell sessions.[272]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionIf proper execution policy is set, adversaries will likely be able to define their own execution policy if they obtain administrator or system access, either through the Registry or at the command line. This change in policy on a system may be a way to detect malicious use of PowerShell. If PowerShell is not used in an environment, then simply looking for PowerShell execution may detect malicious activity. It is also beneficial to turn on PowerShell logging to gain increased fidelity in what occurs during execution (which is applied to .NET invocations).[273]PowerShell 5.0 introduced enhanced logging capabilities, and some of those features have since been added to PowerShell 4.0. Earlier versions of PowerShell do not have many logging features.[274]An organization can gather PowerShell execution details in a data analytic platform to supplement it with other data.PowerShell can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exeFor this to work, certain registry keys must be set, and the WinRM service must be enabled. The PowerShell command Enter-PSSession -ComputerName \<RemoteHost> creates a remote PowerShell session.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor for loading and/or execution of artifacts associated with PowerShell specific assemblies, such as System.Management.Automation.dll (especially to unusual process names/locations).[3][4]Analytic 1 - Processes loading PowerShell assembliessource="*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="7" | where ModulePath LIKE "%system.management.automation%" OR   FileDescription LIKE "%system.management.automation%"DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a scripting environment included with Windows that is used by both attackers and administrators. Execution of PowerShell scripts in most Windows versions is opaque and not typically secured by antivirus which makes using PowerShell an easy way to circumvent security measures. This analytic detects execution of PowerShell scripts.Powershell can be used to hide monitored command line execution such as:net usesc startNote: - The logic for Analytic 1 is based around detecting on non-interactive Powershell sessions (i.e., those not launched by a user through explorer.exe). This may lead to false positives when used in a production environment, so we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., looking for suspicious parent processes) that helps filter such events.- The logic for Analytic 2 is based around detecting on remote Powershell sessions. PowerShell can be used over WinRM to remotely run commands on a host. When a remote PowerShell session starts, svchost.exe executes wsmprovhost.exe.Analytic 1 - Non-interactive Powershell Sessions(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image="powershell.exe" AND ParentImage!="explorer.exe"Analytic 2 - Remote Powershell Sessions(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image="wsmprovhost.exe" AND ParentImage="svchost.exe"Analytic 3 - Powershell Execution(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") Image="C:\Windows\\powershell.exe" ParentImage!="C:\Windows\explorer.exe"|stats values(CommandLine) as "Command Lines" values(ParentImage) as "Parent Images" by ComputerNameProcess MetadataConsider monitoring for Windows event ID (EID) 400, which shows the version of PowerShell executing in theEngineVersionfield (which may also be relevant to detecting a potentialDowngrade Attack) as well as if PowerShell is running locally or remotely in theHostNamefield. Furthermore, EID 400 may indicate the start time and EID 403 indicates the end time of a PowerShell session.[275]DS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.Analytic 1 - Script Block Logging Events(source=WinEventLog:"Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" EventID="4104" AND Image="powershell.exe" AND (CommandLine="-enc" OR CommandLine="-ep bypass" OR CommandLine="-noni*")ReferencesMicrosoft.
