This technique describes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working.×load more resultsContact UsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyWebsite Changelog© 2015 - 2024, The MITRE Corporation.
