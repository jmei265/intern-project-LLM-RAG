This may include things such as cloud monitoring agents and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information fromSecurity Software Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information arenetsh,reg querywithReg,dirwithcmd, andTasklist, but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.Adversaries may also utilize theCloud APIto discover cloud-native security software installed on compute infrastructure, such as the AWS CloudWatch agent, Azure VM Agent, and Google Cloud Monitor agent. These agents  may collect  metrics and logs from the VM, which may be centrally aggregated in a cloud-based monitoring platform.ID:T1518.001Sub-technique of:T1518ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Isif Ibrahima, MandiantVersion:1.5Created:21 February 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0469ABKABKhas the ability to identify the installed anti-virus product on the compromised host.[1]S1028Action RATAction RATcan identify AV products on an infected host using the following command:cmd.exe WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List.[2]S1025AmadeyAmadeyhas checked for a variety of antivirus products.[3][4]G0082APT38APT38has identified security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors installed on a compromised system.[5]G0143Aquatic PandaAquatic Pandahas attempted to discover third party endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools on compromised systems.[6]S0373AstarothAstarothchecks for the presence of Avast antivirus in theC:\Program\Files\folder.[7]S1029AuTo StealerAuTo Stealerhas the ability to collect information about installed AV products from an infected host.[2]S0473AvengerAvengerhas the ability to identify installed anti-virus products on a compromised host.[1]S0337BadPatchBadPatchuses WMI to enumerate installed security products in the victim’s environment.[8]S0534BazarBazarcan identify the installed antivirus engine.[9]S0657BLUELIGHTBLUELIGHTcan collect a list of anti-virus products installed on a machine.[10]S1063Brute Ratel C4Brute Ratel C4can detect EDR userland hooks.[11]S0471build_downerbuild_downerhas the ability to detect if the infected host is running an anti-virus process.[1]S1039BumblebeeBumblebeecan identify specific analytical tools based on running processes.[12][13][14]S0484CarberpCarberphas queried the infected system's registry searching for specific registry keys associated with antivirus products.[15]S0023CHOPSTICKCHOPSTICKchecks for antivirus and forensics software.[16]S0611ClopClopcan search for processes with antivirus and antimalware product names.[17][18]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Groupused a JavaScript backdoor that is capable of collecting a list of the security solutions installed on the victim's machine.[19]S0244ComnieComnieattempts to detect several anti-virus products.[20]S0492CookieMinerCookieMinerhas checked for the presence of "Little Snitch", macOS network monitoring and application firewall software, stopping and exiting if it is found.[21]S0046CozyCarThe mainCozyCardropper checks whether the victim has an anti-virus product installed.

                                    it is based on the abuse of system features.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.Note: For Windows, Event ID 4104 (from the Microsoft-Windows-Powershell/Operational log) captures Powershell script blocks, which can be analyzed and used to detect on potential Security Software Discovery.DS0018FirewallFirewall EnumerationMonitor for an extracted list of available firewalls and/or their associated settings/rules (ex: Azure Network Firewall CLI Show commands)Firewall MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a firewall and activity around it such as name, policy, or statusDS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. OS API calls associated with LSASS process dumping include EnumProcesses, which can be used to enumerate the set of processes running on a host and filtered to look for security-specific processes.Note: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary.Process CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment.ReferencesChen, J. et al.
