Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.[1]Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:SSH (22/TCP)Telnet (23/TCP)FTP (21/TCP)NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)LDAP (389/TCP)Kerberos (88/TCP)RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)MSSQL (1433/TCP)Oracle (1521/TCP)MySQL (3306/TCP)VNC (5900/TCP)SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)In addition to management services, adversaries may "target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols," as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.[2]. Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such aswlanAPI) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.[3]In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows "logon failure" event ID 4625.ID:T1110.001Sub-technique of:T1110ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Mohamed KmalVersion:1.5Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:16 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in brute-force mode it typically sent over 300 authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of several hours or days.[4]APT28has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-scale password guessing attacks.[5]G0016APT29APT29has successfully conducted password guessing attacks against a list of mailboxes.[6]S0020China ChopperChina Chopper's server component can perform brute force password guessing against authentication portals.[7]S0488CrackMapExecCrackMapExeccan brute force passwords for a specified user on a single target system or across an entire network.[8]S0367EmotetEmotethas been observed using a hard coded list of passwords to brute force user accounts.[9][10][11][12][13][14]S0698HermeticWizardHermeticWizardcan use a list of hardcoded credentials in attempt to authenticate to SMB shares.[15]S0532LuciferLuciferhas attempted to brute force TCP ports 135 (RPC) and 1433 (MSSQL) with the default username or list of usernames and    passwords.[16]S0598P.A.S.

Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.[22]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[23]M1051Update SoftwareUpgrade management services to the latest supported and compatible version.  Specifically, any version providing increased password complexity or policy enforcement preventing default or weak passwords.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures ofValid Accounts.
