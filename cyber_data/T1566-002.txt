Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveragingUser Execution. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an "IDN homograph attack").[1]URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an "@" symbol: for example,hxxp://google.com@1157586937.[2]Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries toSteal Application Access Tokens.[3]These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.[4]Adversaries may also utilize spearphishing links toSteal Application Access Tokens that grant immediate access to the victim environment. For example, a user may be lured through "consent phishing" into granting adversaries permissions/access via a malicious OAuth 2.0 request URL .[3][4]Similarly, malicious links may also target device-based authorization, such as OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow which is typically used to authenticate devices without UIs/browsers. Known as "device code phishing," an adversary may send a link that directs the victim to a malicious authorization page where the user is tricked into entering a code/credentials that produces a device token.[5][6][7]ID:T1566.002Sub-technique of:T1566ⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Google Workspace, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Jeff Sakowicz, Microsoft Identity Developer Platform Services (IDPM Services); Kobi Haimovich, CardinalOps; Mark Wee; Menachem Goldstein; Philip Winther; Saisha Agrawal, Microsoft Threat Intelligent Center (MSTIC); Shailesh Tiwary (Indian Army)Version:2.6Created:02 March 2020Last Modified:15 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan send "consent phishing" emails containing malicious links designed to steal users’ access tokens.[8]S0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas been distributed via spearphishing link.[9]G0006APT1APT1has sent spearphishing emails containing hyperlinks to malicious files.[10]G0007APT28APT28sent spearphishing emails which used a URL-shortener service to masquerade as a legitimate service and to redirect targets to credential harvesting sites.[11][12][13][14]G0016APT29APT29has used spearphishing with a link to trick victims into clicking on a link to a zip file containing malicious files.[15][16][17]G0022APT3APT3has sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links.[18]G0050APT32APT32has sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links.[19][20][21][22][23]G0064APT33APT33has sent spearphishing emails containing links to .hta files.[24][25]G0087APT39APT39leveraged spearphishing emails with malicious links to initially compromise victims.[26][27]S0534BazarBazarhas been spread via emails with embedded malicious links.[28][29][30]G0098BlackTechBlackTechhas used spearphishing e-mails with links to cloud services to deliver malware.[31]S1039BumblebeeBumblebeehas been spread through e-mail campaigns with malicious links.[32][33]C0011C0011DuringC0011,Transparent Tribesent emails containing a malicious link to student targets in India.[34]C0021C0021DuringC0021, the threat actors sent phishing emails with unique malicious links, likely for tracking victim clicks.[35][36]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas sent emails with URLs pointing to malicious documents.[37][38]G0142ConfuciusConfuciushas sent malicious links to victims through email campaigns.[39]S1111DarkGateDarkGateis distributed in phishing emails containing links to distribute malicious VBS or MSI files.[40]DarkGateuses applications such as Microsoft Teams for distributing links to payloads.[40]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas sent spearphishing emails to potential targets that contained a malicious link.[41]G0066ElderwoodElderwoodhas delivered zero-day exploits and malware to victims via targeted emails containing a link to malicious content hosted on an uncommon Web server.[42][43]G1003Ember BearEmber Bearhas sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links.[44]S0367EmotetEmotethas been delivered by phishing emails containing links.[45][46][47][48][49][50][51][51][52]G0120EvilnumEvilnumhas sent spearphishing emails containing a link to a zip file hosted on Google Drive.[53]G1011EXOTIC LILYEXOTIC LILYhas relied on victims to open malicious links in e-mails for execution.[54]G0085FIN4FIN4has used spearphishing emails (often sent from compromised accounts) containing malicious links.[55][56]G0046FIN7FIN7has conducted broad phishing campaigns using malicious links.[57]G0061FIN8FIN8has distributed targeted emails containing links to malicious documents with embedded macros.[58]S0531GrandoreiroGrandoreirohas been spread via malicious links embedded in e-mails.[59][60]S0561GuLoaderGuLoaderhas been spread in phishing campaigns using malicious web links.[61]S0499HancitorHancitorhas been delivered via phishing emails which contained malicious links.[62]S0528JavaliJavalihas been delivered via malicious links embedded in e-mails.[63]S0585KerrdownKerrdownhas been distributed via e-mails containing a malicious link.[23]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas sent spearphishing emails containing a link to a document that contained malicious macros or took the victim to an actor-controlled domain.[64][65][66]S0669KOCTOPUSKOCTOPUShas been distributed as a malicious link within an email.[67]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas sent malicious links to victims via email.[68]G0140LazyScripterLazyScripterhas used spam emails that contain a link that redirects the victim to download a malicious document.[67]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas sent spearphishing emails with links, often using a fraudulent lookalike domain and stolen branding.[69][70]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas sent spearphishing emails containing a malicious Dropbox download link.[71]G0095MacheteMachetehas sent phishing emails that contain a link to an external server with ZIP and RAR archives.[72][73]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas sent malicious URL links through email to victims.

Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.[124][125].Furthermore, policies may enforce / install browser extensions that protect against IDN and homograph attacks.M1018User Account ManagementAzure AD Administrators apply limitations upon the ability for users to grant consent to unfamiliar or unverified third-party applications.M1017User TrainingUsers can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails with malicious links which includes phishing for consent with OAuth 2.0. Additionally, users may perform visual checks of the domains they visit; however, homographs in ASCII and in IDN domains and URL schema obfuscation may render manual checks difficult. Phishing training and other cybersecurity training may raise awareness to check URLs before visiting the sites.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.[124][125]URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links and identifying obfuscated URLs) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites.[2]Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.Furthermore, monitor browser logs for homographs in ASCII and in internationalized domain names abusing different character sets (e.g. Cyrillic vs Latin versions of trusted sites).DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze SSL/TLS traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g. extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Furthermore, monitor network traffic for cloned sites as well as homographs via the use of internationalized domain names abusing different character sets (e.g. Cyrillic vs Latin versions of trusted sites).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesCISA. (2019, September 27).
