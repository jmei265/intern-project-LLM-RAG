Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done throughNetwork Service Discoveryor other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB[1]and RDP[2]as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL[3]and web server services.[4]Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieveExploitation for Privilege Escalationas a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.ID:T1210Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Unpatched software or otherwise vulnerable target. Depending on the target and goal, the system and exploitable service may need to be remotely accessible from the internal network.ⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:ExtraHopVersion:1.1Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:24 February 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28exploited a Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability to conduct lateral movement.[5][6][7]S0606Bad RabbitBad Rabbitused the EternalRomance SMB exploit to spread through victim networks.[8]S0608ConfickerConfickerexploited the MS08-067 Windows vulnerability for remote code execution through a crafted RPC request.[9]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas exploited a Windows Netlogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) to obtain access to Windows Active Directory servers.[10]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas usedMimikatzto exploit a domain controller via the ZeroLogon exploit (CVE-2020-1472).[11]S0367EmotetEmotethas been seen exploiting SMB via a vulnerability exploit like EternalBlue (MS17-010) to achieve lateral movement and propagation.[12][13][14][15]S0363EmpireEmpirehas a limited number of built-in modules for exploiting remote SMB, JBoss, and Jenkins servers.[16]G0046FIN7FIN7has exploited ZeroLogon (CVE-2020-1472) against vulnerable domain controllers.[17]S0143FlameFlamecan use MS10-061 to exploit a print spooler vulnerability in a remote system with a shared printer in order to move laterally.[18][19]G0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas exploited known vulnerabilities in remote services including RDP.[20][21][22]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan spread within a network via the BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) and EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) vulnerabilities in RDP and SMB respectively.[23]S0532LuciferLucifercan exploit multiple vulnerabilities including EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) and EternalRomance (CVE-2017-0144).[24]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas used tools to exploit the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472).[25]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas exploited the Microsoft Netlogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472).[26]S0368NotPetyaNotPetyacan use two exploits in SMBv1, EternalBlue and EternalRomance, to spread itself to other remote systems on the network.[27][28][29]S0378PoshC2PoshC2contains a module for exploiting SMB via EternalBlue.[30]S0650QakBotQakBotcan move laterally using worm-like functionality through exploitation of SMB.[31]S0603StuxnetStuxnetpropagates using the MS10-061 Print Spooler and MS08-067 Windows Server Service vulnerabilities.[32]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has exploited MS17-010 to move laterally to other systems on the network.[33]G0131Tonto TeamTonto Teamhas used EternalBlue exploits for lateral movement.[34]S0266TrickBotTrickBotutilizes EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits for lateral movement in the modules wormwinDll, wormDll, mwormDll, nwormDll, tabDll.[35]S0366WannaCryWannaCryuses an exploit in SMBv1 to spread itself to other remote systems on a network.[36][37][38]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas exploited or attempted to exploit Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) and EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerabilities.[39][40][41]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1048Application Isolation and SandboxingMake it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing. Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in these systems may still exist.[42]M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramMinimize available services to only those that are necessary.M1050Exploit ProtectionSecurity applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior.[43]Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring.[44]Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for all software or services targeted.M1030Network SegmentationSegment networks and systems appropriately to reduce access to critical systems and services to controlled methods.M1026Privileged Account ManagementMinimize permissions and access for service accounts to limit impact of exploitation.M1019Threat Intelligence ProgramDevelop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat may use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organization.M1051Update SoftwareUpdate software regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and servers.M1016Vulnerability ScanningRegularly scan the internal network for available services to identify new and potentially vulnerable services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentDetecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available.
