This may provide the adversary with various plaintext passwords, such as those for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.[2][3]In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords.[2][4]Apple’ssecuritydutility takes the user’s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory. Apple also uses a set of keys and algorithms to encrypt the user’s password, but once the master key is found, an adversary need only iterate over the other values to unlock the final password.[2]ID:T1555.002Sub-technique of:T1555ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, macOSVersion:1.2Created:12 February 2020Last Modified:29 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0276KeydnapKeydnapuses the keychaindump project to read securityd memory.[5]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
