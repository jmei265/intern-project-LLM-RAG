Information about identities may include a variety of details, including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, security question responses, etc.) as well as sensitive details such as credentials or multi-factor authentication (MFA) configurations.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation viaPhishing for Information. Information about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e.Active Scanning) such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system or permitted MFA /methods associated with those usernames.[1][2]Information about victims may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Social MediaorSearch Victim-Owned Websites).[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorPhishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex:Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:PhishingorValid Accounts).ID:T1589Sub-techniques:T1589.001,T1589.002,T1589.003ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Obsidian SecurityVersion:1.3Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0050APT32APT32has conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers.[11]G1016FIN13FIN13has researched employees to target for social engineering attacks.[12]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas identified specific potential victims at targeted organizations.[13]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has gathered detailed information of target employees to enhance their social engineering lures.[14]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas acquired mobile phone numbers of potential targets, possibly for mobile malware or additional phishing operations.[15]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupconducted extensive reconnaissance research on potential targets.[16]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors targeted people based on their organizational roles and privileges.[17]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor for suspicious network traffic that could be indicative of probing for user information, such as large/iterative quantities of authentication requests originating from a single source (especially if the source is known to be associated with an adversary/botnet). Analyzing web metadata may also reveal artifacts that can be attributed to potentially malicious activity, such as referer or user-agent string HTTP/S fields.ReferencesGrimHacker. (2017, July 24).
