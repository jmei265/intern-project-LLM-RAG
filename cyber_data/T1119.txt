Methods for performing this technique could include use of aCommand and Scripting Interpreterto search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.In cloud-based environments, adversaries may also use cloud APIs, data pipelines, command line interfaces, or extract, transform, and load (ETL) services to automatically collect data.[1]This functionality could also be built into remote access tools.This technique may incorporate use of other techniques such asFile and Directory DiscoveryandLateral Tool Transferto identify and move files, as well asCloud Service DashboardandCloud Storage Object Discoveryto identify resources in cloud environments.ID:T1119Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Permissions to access directories, files, and API endpoints that store information of interest.Contributors:PraetorianVersion:1.2Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:02 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0622AppleSeedAppleSeedhas automatically collected data from USB drives, keystrokes, and screen images before exfiltration.[2]G0006APT1APT1used a batch script to perform a series of discovery techniques and saves it to a text file.[3]G0007APT28APT28used a publicly available tool to gather and compress multiple documents on the DCCC and DNC networks.[4]S0438AttorAttorhas automatically collected data about the compromised system.[5]S0128BADNEWSBADNEWSmonitors USB devices and copies files with certain extensions to a predefined directory.[6]S0239BankshotBankshotrecursively generates a list of files within a directory and sends them back to the control server.[7]S1043ccf32ccf32can be used to automatically collect files from a compromised host.[8]G0114ChimeraChimerahas used custom DLLs for continuous retrieval of data from memory.[9]S0244ComnieComnieexecutes a batch script to store discovery information in %TEMP%\info.dat and then uploads the temporarily file to the remote C2 server.[10]G0142ConfuciusConfuciushas used a file stealer to steal documents and images with the following extensions: txt, pdf, png, jpg, doc, xls, xlm, odp, ods, odt, rtf, ppt, xlsx, xlsm, docx, pptx, and jpeg.[11]S0538CrutchCrutchcan automatically monitor removable drives in a loop and copy interesting files.[12]S1111DarkGateDarkGatesearches for stored credentials associated with cryptocurrency wallets and notifies the command and control server when identified.[13]S0363EmpireEmpirecan automatically gather the username, domain name, machine name, and other information from a compromised system.[14]G0053FIN5FIN5scans processes on all victim systems in the environment and uses automated scripts to pull back the results.[15]G0037FIN6FIN6has used a script to iterate through a list of compromised PoS systems, copy and remove data to a log file, and to bind to events from the submit payment button.[16][17]C0001FrankensteinDuringFrankenstein, the threat actors usedEmpireto automatically gather the username, domain name, machine name, and other system information.[14]S1044FunnyDreamFunnyDreamcan monitor files for changes and automatically collect them.[8]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas deployed scripts on compromised systems that automatically scan for interesting documents.[18]S0597GoldFinderGoldFinderlogged and stored information related to the route or hops a packet took from a compromised machine to a hardcoded C2 server, including the target C2 URL, HTTP response/status code, HTTP response headers and values, and data received from the C2 node.[19]S0170HelminthAHelminthVBScript receives a batch script to execute a set of commands in a command prompt.[20]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan sort and collect specific documents as well as generate a list of all files on a newly inserted drive and store them in an encrypted file.[21][22]G0004Ke3changKe3changhas performed frequent and scheduled data collection from victim networks.[23]S0395LightNeuronLightNeuroncan be configured to automatically collect files under a specified directory.[24]S1101LoFiSeLoFiSecan collect all the files from the working directory every three hours and place them into a password-protected archive for further exfiltration.[25]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas used the Csvde tool to collect Active Directory files and data.[26]S0443MESSAGETAPMESSAGETAPchecks two files, keyword_parm.txt and parm.txt, for instructions on how to target and save data parsed and extracted from SMS message data from the network traffic.

Strong passwords should be used on certain encrypted documents that use them to prevent offline cracking throughBrute Forcetechniques.M1029Remote Data StorageEncryption and off-system storage of sensitive information may be one way to mitigate collection of files, but may not stop an adversary from acquiring the information if an intrusion persists over a long period of time and the adversary is able to discover and access the data through other means.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that could be taken to collect internal data.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for unexpected files (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .jpg, etc.) viewed for collecting internal data.DS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.ReferencesMandiant Intelligence. (2023, September 14). Why Are You Texting Me?
