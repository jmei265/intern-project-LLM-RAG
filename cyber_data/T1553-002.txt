Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with.[1]The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary.[2][3]UnlikeInvalid Code Signature, this activity will result in a valid signature.Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform.[1][4]Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.ID:T1553.002Sub-technique of:T1553ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Windows User Account ControlVersion:1.1Created:05 February 2020Last Modified:22 September 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0504AnchorAnchorhas been signed with valid certificates to evade detection by security tools.[5]S0584AppleJeusAppleJeushas used a valid digital signature from Sectigo to appear legitimate.[6]G0096APT41APT41leveraged code-signing certificates to sign malware when targeting both gaming and non-gaming organizations.[7][8]S0475BackConfigBackConfighas been signed with self signed digital certificates mimicking a legitimate software company.[9]S0234BandookBandookwas signed with valid Certum certificates.[10]S0534BazarBazarhas been signed with fake certificates including those appearing to be from VB CORPORATE PTY.
