They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.One such example is the use ofcertutilto decode a remote access tool portable executable file that has been hidden inside a certificate file.[1]Another example is using the Windowscopy /bcommand to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload.[2]Sometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part ofUser Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary.[3]ID:T1140Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Defense

                                    it is based on the abuse of system features.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor for changes made to files for unexpected modifications that attempt to hide artifacts. On Windows, Event ID 4663 (Security Log - An attempt was made to access an object) can be used to alert on suspicious file accesses (e.g., attempting to write to a file which shouldn’t be further modified) that may coincide with attempts to hide artifacts.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that attempt to hide artifacts of an intrusion, such as common archive file applications and extensions (ex: Zip and RAR archive tools), and correlate with other suspicious behavior to reduce false positives from normal user and administrator behavior.CertUtil.exe may be used to encode and decode a file, including PE and script code. Encoding will convert a file to base64 with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE----- tags. Malicious usage will include decoding an encoded file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process. Note that there are two additional command switches that may be used - encodehex and decodehex. Similarly, the file will be encoded in HEX and later decoded for further execution. During triage, identify the source of the file being decoded. Review its contents or execution behavior for further analysis.Analytic Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 1 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The analytic is oriented around the creation of CertUtil.exe processes, which may be used to encode and decode files, including PE and script code. Malicious usage will include decoding a encoded file that was downloaded. Once decoded, it will be loaded by a parallel process.Analytic 1 - CertUtil with Decode Argument(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") Image="C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe" AND  CommandLine=decode)DS0012ScriptScript ExecutionMonitor for any attempts to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.ReferencesMalwarebytes Labs. (2017, March 27). New targeted attack against Saudi Arabia Government.
