For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.ID:T1565Sub-techniques:T1565.001,T1565.002,T1565.003ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:IntegrityVersion:1.1Created:02 March 2020Last Modified:02 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1016FIN13FIN13has injected fraudulent transactions into compromised networks that mimic legitimate behavior to siphon off incremental amounts of money.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationConsider encrypting important information to reduce an adversary’s ability to perform tailored data modifications.M1030Network SegmentationIdentify critical business and system processes that may be targeted by adversaries and work to isolate and secure those systems against unauthorized access and tampering.M1029Remote Data StorageConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.[2]Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and manipulate backups.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsEnsure least privilege principles are applied to important information resources to reduce exposure to data manipulation risk.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of a file in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile MetadataMonitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/owner, permissions, etc that would aid in the manipulation of data to hide activityFile ModificationMonitor for unexpected files with manipulated data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor for networks that solicits and obtains the configuration information of the queried device.Network Traffic FlowMonitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls associated with altering data.
