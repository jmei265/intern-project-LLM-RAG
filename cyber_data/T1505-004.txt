IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions:Get{Extension/Filter}Version,Http{Extension/Filter}Proc, and (optionally)Terminate{Extension/Filter}. IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.[1][2][3][4]Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and control traffic. ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses. For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts.[2][1][5][6][4][7]Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic. IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters. IIS modules can be written as a DLL that exportsRegisterModule, or as a .NET application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests.[8][4][9]ID:T1505.004Sub-technique of:T1505ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEMContributors:Wes HurdVersion:1.0Created:03 June 2021Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1022IceAppleIceAppleis an IIS post-exploitation framework, consisting of 18 modules that provide several functionalities.[10]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Grouptargeted Windows servers running Internet Information Systems (IIS) to install C2 components.[11]S0072OwaAuthOwaAuthhas been loaded onto Exchange servers and disguised as an ISAPI filter (owaauth.dll).
