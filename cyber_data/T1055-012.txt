Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such asCreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such asZwUnmapViewOfSectionorNtUnmapViewOfSectionbefore being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed viaVirtualAllocEx,WriteProcessMemory,SetThreadContext, thenResumeThreadrespectively.[1][2]This is very similar toThread Local Storagebut creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.ID:T1055.012Sub-technique of:T1055ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application controlVersion:1.3Created:14 January 2020Last Modified:11 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas used process hollowing to create and manipulate processes through sections of unmapped memory by reallocating that space with its malicious code.[3]S0373AstarothAstarothcan create a new process in a suspended state from a targeted legitimate process in order to unmap its memory and replace it with malicious code.[4][5]S0344AzorultAzorultcan decrypt the payload into memory, create a new suspended process of itself, then inject a decrypted payload to the new process and resume new process execution.[6]S0128BADNEWSBADNEWShas a command to download an .exe and use process hollowing to inject it into a new process.[7][8]S0234BandookBandookhas been launched by starting iexplore.exe and replacing it withBandook's payload.[9][10][11]S0534BazarBazarcan inject into a target process including Svchost, Explorer, and cmd using process hollowing.[12][13]S0127BBSRATBBSRAThas been seen loaded into msiexec.exe through process hollowing to hide its execution.[14]S0660ClamblingClamblingcan execute binaries through process hollowing.[15]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan use process hollowing for execution.[16][17]S1111DarkGateDarkGateleverages process hollowing techniques to evade detection, such as decrypting the content of an encrypted PE file and injecting it into the process vbc.exe.[18]S0354DenisDenisperformed process hollowing through the API calls CreateRemoteThread, ResumeThread, and Wow64SetThreadContext.[19]S0567DtrackDtrackhas used process hollowing shellcode to target a predefined list of processes from%SYSTEM32%.[20]S0038DuquDuquis capable of loading executable code via process hollowing.[21]G0078Gorgon GroupGorgon Groupmalware can use process hollowing to inject one of its trojans into another process.[22]S0189ISMInjectorISMInjectorhollows out a newly created process RegASM.exe and injects its payload into the hollowed process.[23]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used a file injector DLL to spawn a benign process on the victim's system and inject the malicious payload into it via process hollowing.[24]S0447LokibotLokibothas used process hollowing to inject itself into legitimate Windows process.[25][26]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas used process hollowing in iexplore.exe to load theRedLeavesimplant.[27]S0198NETWIRETheNETWIREpayload has been injected into benign Microsoft executables via process hollowing.[28][29]S0229OrzSomeOrzversions have an embedded DLL known as MockDll that uses process hollowing andRegsvr32to execute another payload.[30]G0040PatchworkAPatchworkpayload uses process hollowing to hide the UAC bypass vulnerability exploitation inside svchost.exe.[31]S0650QakBotQakBotcan use process hollowing to execute its main payload.[32]S0662RCSessionRCSessioncan launch itself from a hollowed svchost.exe process.[33][15][34]S1018Saint BotTheSaint Botloader has used API calls to spawnMSBuild.exein a suspended state before injecting the decryptedSaint Botbinary into it.[35]S0226Smoke LoaderSmoke Loaderspawns a new copy of c:\windows\syswow64\explorer.exe and then replaces the executable code in memory with malware.[36][37]S1086Snip3Snip3can use RunPE to execute malicious payloads within a hollowed Windows process.[38][39]G1018TA2541TA2541has used process hollowing to execute CyberGate malware.[40]G0027Threat Group-3390AThreat Group-3390tool can spawnsvchost.exeand inject the payload into that process.[41][42]S0266TrickBotTrickBotinjects into the svchost.exe process.[43][44][45][46]S0386UrsnifUrsnifhas used process hollowing to inject into child processes.[47]S0689WhisperGateWhisperGatehas the ability to inject its fourth stage into a suspended process created by the legitimate Windows utilityInstallUtil.exe.[48][49]S1065Woody RATWoody RATcan create a suspended notepad process and write shellcode to delete a file into the suspended process usingNtWriteVirtualMemory.[50]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointSome endpoint security solutions can be configured to block some types of process injection based on common sequences of behavior that occur during the injection process.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitoring Windows API calls indicative of the various types of code injection may generate a significant amount of data and may not be directly useful for defense unless collected under specific circumstances for known bad sequences of calls, since benign use of API functions may be common and difficult to distinguish from malicious behavior. Windows API calls such asCreateRemoteThread,SuspendThread/SetThreadContext/ResumeThread, and those that can be used to modify memory within another process, such asVirtualAllocEx/WriteProcessMemory, may be used for this technique.[2]Process AccessMonitor for processes being viewed that may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses.Process CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Adversaries may start legitimate processes and then use their memory space to run malicious code. This analytic looks for common Windows processes that have been abused this way in the past; when the processes are started for this purpose they may not have the standard parent that we would expect. This list is not exhaustive, and it is possible for cyber actors to avoid this discepency. These signatures only work if Sysmon reports the parent process, which may not always be the case if the parent dies before sysmon processes the event.Analytic 1 - Processes Started From Irregular Parents(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND ParentImage!="?"
