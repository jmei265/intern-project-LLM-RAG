Systemd timers are unit files with file extension.timerthat control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative toCronin Linux environments.[1]Systemd timers may be activated remotely via thesystemctlcommand line utility, which operates overSSH.[2]Each.timerfile must have a corresponding.servicefile with the same name, e.g.,example.timerandexample.service..servicefiles areSystemd Serviceunit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.[3]Privileged timers are written to/etc/systemd/system/and/usr/lib/systemd/systemwhile user level are written to~/.config/systemd/user/.An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.[4][5][6]Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence. Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.[7]ID:T1053.006Sub-technique of:T1053ⓘTactics:Execution,Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:LinuxⓘPermissions Required:User, rootⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:SarathKumar Rajendran, Trimble IncVersion:1.2Created:12 October 2020Last Modified:08 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit access to the root account and prevent users from creating and/or modifying systemd timer unit files.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsRestrict read/write access to systemd.timerunit files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services.M1018User Account ManagementLimit user access to system utilities such as 'systemctl' or 'systemd-run' to users who have a legitimate need.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments the 'systemd-run' utility as it may be used to create timersDS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor for changes made to systemd timer unit files for unexpected modification events within the /etc/systemd/system, /usr/lib/systemd/system/, and ~/.config/systemd/user/ directories, as well as associated symbolic linksDS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that will have a parent process of ‘systemd’, a parent process ID of 1, and will usually execute as the ‘root’ user.DS0003Scheduled JobScheduled Job CreationSuspicious systemd timers can also be identified by comparing results against a trusted system baseline. Malicious systemd timers may be detected by using the systemctl utility to examine system wide timers: systemctl list-timers –all. Analyze the contents of corresponding .service files present on the file system and ensure that they refer to legitimate, expected executables.Referencesarchlinux. (2020, August 11). systemd/Timers.
