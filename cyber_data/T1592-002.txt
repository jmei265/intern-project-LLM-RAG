Information about installed software may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: antivirus, SIEMs, etc.).Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions viaActive Scanning(ex: listening ports, server banners, user agent strings) orPhishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.[1]Information about the installed software may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Develop CapabilitiesorObtain Capabilities), and/or for initial access (ex:Supply Chain CompromiseorExternal Remote Services).ID:T1592.002Sub-technique of:T1592ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0138AndarielAndarielhas inserted a malicious script within compromised websites to collect potential victim information such as browser type, system language, Flash Player version, and other data.[2]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas captured the user-agent strings from visitors to their phishing sites.[3]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas researched software code to enable supply-chain operations, most notably for the 2017NotPetyaattack.Sandworm Teamalso collected a list of computers using specific software as part of its targeting efforts.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentInternet scanners may be used to look for patterns associated with malicious content designed to collect host software information from visitors.[5][1]Much of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesBlasco, J. (2014, August 28).
