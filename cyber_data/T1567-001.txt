Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.ID:T1567.001Sub-technique of:T1567ⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:15 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0363EmpireEmpirecan use GitHub for data exfiltration.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1021Restrict Web-Based ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed command and arguments that may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for files being accessed to exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Monitor for use of code repositories for data exfiltration.ReferencesSchroeder, W., Warner, J., Nelson, M. (n.d.). Github PowerShellEmpire.
