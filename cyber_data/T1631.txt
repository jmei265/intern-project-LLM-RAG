Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.Both Android and iOS have no legitimate way to achieve process injection. The only way this is possible is by abusing existing root access or exploiting a vulnerability.ID:T1631Sub-techniques:T1631.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
