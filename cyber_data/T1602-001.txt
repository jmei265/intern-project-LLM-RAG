Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables. SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages[1]. The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details.Adversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information that allows the adversary to build network maps and facilitate future targeted exploitation.[2][3]ID:T1602.001Sub-technique of:T1602ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:22 October 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationConfigure SNMPv3 to use the highest level of security (authPriv) available.[4]M1037Filter Network TrafficApply extended ACLs to block unauthorized protocols outside the trusted network.[4]M1031Network Intrusion PreventionConfigure intrusion prevention devices to detect SNMP queries and commands from unauthorized sources.[2]M1030Network SegmentationSegregate SNMP traffic on a separate management network.[4]M1054Software ConfigurationAllowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views.[5]M1051Update SoftwareKeep system images and software updated and migrate to SNMPv3.[3]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts or uncommon data flows.
