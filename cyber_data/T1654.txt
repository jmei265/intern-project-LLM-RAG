These logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such as user authentication records (Account Discovery), security or vulnerable software (Software Discovery), or hosts within a compromised network (Remote System Discovery).Host binaries may be leveraged to collect system logs. Examples include usingwevtutil.exeorPowerShellon Windows to access and/or export security event information.[1][2]In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’sCollectGuestLogs.exeto collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure.[3]Adversaries may also target centralized logging infrastructure such as SIEMs. Logs may also be bulk exported and sent to adversary-controlled infrastructure for offline analysis.ID:T1654Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Bilal Bahadır YeniciVersion:1.0Created:10 July 2023Last Modified:30 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1023APT5APT5has used the BLOODMINE utility to parse and extract information from Pulse Secure Connect logs.[4]S1091PacuPacucan collect CloudTrail event histories and CloudWatch logs.[5]G1017Volt TyphoonVolt Typhoonhas usedwevtutil.exeand the PowerShell commandGet-EventLog securityto enumerate Windows logs to search for successful logons.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1018User Account ManagementLimit the ability to access and export sensitive logs to privileged accounts where possible.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor for the use of commands and arguments of utilities and other tools used to access and export logs.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor for access to system and service log files, especially from unexpected and abnormal users.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for unexpected process activity associated with utilities that can access and export logs, such aswevutil.exeon Windows andCollectGuestLogs.exeon Azure hosted VMs.ReferencesRuohonen, S. & Robinson, S.
