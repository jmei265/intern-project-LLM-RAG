Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).ID:T1102.001Sub-technique of:T1102ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:14 March 2020Last Modified:26 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41APT41used legitimate websites for C2 through dead drop resolvers (DDR), including GitHub, Pastebin, and Microsoft TechNet.[1]S0373AstarothAstarothcan store C2 information on cloud hosting services such as AWS and CloudFlare and websites like YouTube and Facebook.[2]S0128BADNEWSBADNEWScollects C2 information via a dead drop resolver.[3][4][5]S0069BLACKCOFFEEBLACKCOFFEEuses Microsoft’s TechNet Web portal to obtain a dead drop resolver containing an encoded tag with the IP address of a command and control server.[6][7]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLER's MSGET downloader uses a dead drop resolver to access malicious payloads.[8]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41used dead drop resolvers on two separate tech community forums for theirKEYPLUGWindows-version backdoor; notablyAPT41updated the community forum posts frequently with new dead drop resolvers during the campaign.[9]S0674CharmPowerCharmPowercan retrieve C2 domain information from actor-controlled S3 buckets.[10]S0531GrandoreiroGrandoreirocan obtain C2 information from Google Docs.[2]S0528JavaliJavalican read C2 information from Google Documents and YouTube.[2]S1051KEYPLUGTheKEYPLUGWindows variant has retrieved C2 addresses from encoded data in posts on tech community forums.[9]S0455MetamorfoMetamorfohas used YouTube to store and hide C&C server domains.[11]S0051MiniDukeSomeMiniDukecomponents use Twitter to initially obtain the address of a C2 server or as a backup if no hard-coded C2 server responds.[12][13][14]G0040PatchworkPatchworkhides base64-encoded and encrypted C2 server locations in comments on legitimate websites.[15]S0013PlugXPlugXuses Pastebin to store C2 addresses.[16]S0518PolyglotDukePolyglotDukecan use Twitter, Reddit, Imgur and other websites to get a C2 URL.[14]G0106RockeRockehas used Pastebin to check the version of beaconing malware and redirect to another Pastebin hosting updated malware.[17]S0148RTMRTMhas used an RSS feed on Livejournal to update a list of encrypted C2 server names.RTMhas also hiddenPonyC2 server IP addresses within transactions on the Bitcoin and Namecoin blockchain.[18][19][20]G0048RTMRTMhas used an RSS feed on Livejournal to update a list of encrypted C2 server names.[18]S0341XbashXbashcan obtain a webpage hosted on Pastebin to update its C2 domain list.[21]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.M1021Restrict Web-Based ContentWeb proxies can be used to enforce external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
