Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such asArchive Collected Data. Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality withincmdand bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary mayCreate Cloud Instanceand stage data in that instance.[1]By staging data on one system prior to Exfiltration, adversaries can minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.ID:T1074.002Sub-technique of:T1074ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:PraetorianVersion:1.1Created:13 March 2020Last Modified:08 March 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has staged archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server.[2]S1043ccf32ccf32has copied files to a remote machine infected withChinoxyor another backdoor.[3]G0114ChimeraChimerahas staged stolen data on designated servers in the target environment.[4]G0037FIN6FIN6actors have compressed data from remote systems and moved it to another staging system before exfiltration.[5]G0061FIN8FIN8aggregates staged data from a network into a single location.[6]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas staged data remotely prior to exfiltration.[7]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas staged data on remote MSP systems or other victim networks prior to exfiltration.[8][9]G1019MoustachedBouncerMoustachedBouncerhas used plugins to save captured screenshots to.\AActdata\on an SMB share.[10]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors copied files to company web servers and subsequently downloaded them.[11]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29staged data and files in password-protected archives on a victim's OWA server.[12]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has moved staged encrypted archives to Internet-facing servers that had previously been compromised withChina Chopperprior to exfiltration.[13]G1022ToddyCatToddyCatmanually transferred collected files to an exfiltration host using xcopy.[14]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather and copy to a location. Data may also be acquired and staged through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor processes that appear to be reading files from disparate locations and writing them to the same directory or file may be an indication of data being staged, especially if they are suspected of performing encryption or compression on the files, such as 7zip, RAR, ZIP, or zlib.File CreationMonitor publicly writeable directories, central locations, and commonly used staging directories (recycle bin, temp folders, etc.) to regularly check for compressed or encrypted data that may be indicative of staging.ReferencesMandiant.
