Many cloud providers offer interactive connections to virtual infrastructure that can be accessed through theCloud API, such as Azure Serial Console[1], AWS EC2 Instance Connect[2][3], and AWS System Manager.[4].Methods of authentication for these connections can include passwords, application access tokens, or SSH keys. These cloud native methods may, by default, allow for privileged access on the host with SYSTEM or root level access.Adversaries may utilize these cloud native methods to directly access virtual infrastructure and pivot through an environment.[5]These connections typically provide direct console access to the VM rather than the execution of scripts (i.e.,Cloud Administration Command).ID:T1021.008Sub-technique of:T1021ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:IaaSContributors:Thanabodi Phrakhun, @naikordianVersion:1.0Created:02 June 2023Last Modified:27 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramIf direct virtual machine connections are not required for administrative use, disable these connection types where feasible.M1018User Account ManagementLimit which users are allowed to access compute infrastructure via cloud native methods.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor cloud audit logs and host logs for logon session events.
