This may be performed during automated discovery and can be accomplished in numerous ways such as usingPing,tracert, and GET requests to websites.Adversaries may use the results and responses from these requests to determine if the system is capable of communicating with their C2 servers before attempting to connect to them. The results may also be used to identify routes, redirectors, and proxy servers.ID:T1016.001Sub-technique of:T1016ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:17 March 2021Last Modified:25 March 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has ensured web servers in a victim environment are Internet accessible before copying tools or malware to it.[1]S1066DarkTortillaDarkTortillacan check for internet connectivity by issuing HTTP GET requests.[2]G1016FIN13FIN13has usedPingandtracertfor network reconnaissance efforts.[3]G0061FIN8FIN8has used thePingcommand to check connectivity to actor-controlled C2 servers.[4]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas tested connectivity between a compromised machine and a C2 server usingPingwith commands such asCSIDL_SYSTEM\cmd.exe /c ping -n 1.[5]S0597GoldFinderGoldFinderperformed HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors that an HTTP request traveled through.[6]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas checked for network connectivity from a compromised host usingping, including attempts to contactgoogle[.]com.[7]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used tools includingBITSAdminto test internet connectivity from compromised hosts.[8]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas conducted a network call out to a specific website as part of their initial discovery activity.[9]S0284More_eggsMore_eggshas used HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity.[10]S0691NeoichorNeoichorcan check for Internet connectivity by contacting bing[.]com with the request formatbing[.]com?id=<GetTickCount>.[11]S1107NKAbuseNKAbuseutilizes external services such asifconfig.meto identify the victim machine's IP address.[12]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors used a Visual Basic script that checked for internet connectivity.[13]S0650QakBotQakBotcan measure the download speed on a targeted host.[14]S0686QuietSieveQuietSievecan check C2 connectivity with apingto 8.8.8.8 (Google public DNS).[15]S0448Rising SunRising Suncan test a connection to a specified network IP address over a specified port number.[16]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29usedGoldFinderto perform HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors that an HTTP request travels through.[6]S1049SUGARUSHSUGARUSHhas checked for internet connectivity from an infected host before attempting to establish a new TCP connection.[17]S0663SysUpdateSysUpdatecan contact the DNS server operated by Google as part of its C2 establishment process.[18]G1018TA2541TA2541has run scripts to check internet connectivity from compromised hosts.[19]G0010TurlaTurlahas usedtracertto check internet connectivity.[20]S1065Woody RATWoody RATcan makePingGET HTTP requests to its C2 server at regular intervals for network connectivity checks.[21]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
