There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. Theschtasksutility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.The deprecatedatutility could also be abused by adversaries (ex:At), thoughat.execan not access tasks created withschtasksor the Control Panel.An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar toSystem Binary Proxy Execution, adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.[1]Adversaries may also create "hidden" scheduled tasks (i.e.Hide Artifacts) that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, an adversary may hide a task fromschtasks /queryand the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).[2][3]Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g.,Indexvalue) within associated registry keys.[4]ID:T1053.005Sub-technique of:T1053ⓘTactics:Execution,Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:Andrew Northern,

The associated Registry key is located at HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\SubmitControl.

Task Scheduler stores tasks as files in two locations - C:\Windows\Tasks (legacy) or C:\Windows\System32\Tasks. Accordingly, this analytic looks for the creation of task files in these two locations.Analytic 1 - Scheduled Task - File Creation(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="11") (TargetFilename= "C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\" OR TargetFilename  "C:\Windows\Tasks\*")  AND Image!= "C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe"File ModificationMonitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in %systemroot%\System32\Tasks for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Look for RPC traffic after being mapped, which implies a destination port of at least 49152. If network inspection is available via packet captures or a NIDS, then traffic through theITaskSchedulerServiceinterface can be detected. Microsoft has a list of the possible methods that are implemented for theITaskSchedulerServiceinterface, which may be useful in differentiating read and query operations from creations and modifications.When scheduled tasks are created remotely, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the Task Scheduler on the remote machine. Once an RPC connection is established, the client communicates with the Scheduled Tasks endpoint, which runs within the service group netsvcs. With packet capture and the right packet decoders or byte-stream based signatures, remote invocations of these functions can be identified.Certain strings can be identifiers of the schtasks, by looking up the interface UUID of ITaskSchedulerService in different formatsUUID86d35949-83c9-4044-b424-db363231fd0c(decoded)Hex49 59 d3 86 c9 83 44 40 b4 24 db 36 32 31 fd 0c(raw)ASCIIIYD@$621(printable bytes only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement an analytic.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that execute from the svchost.exe in Windows 10 and the Windows Task Scheduler taskeng.exe for older versions of Windows.[198]If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Look for instances ofschtasks.exerunning as processes. Thecommand_linefield is necessary to disambiguate between types of schtasks commands. These include the flags/create,/run,/query,/delete,/change, and/end.Detection of the creation or modification of Scheduled Tasks with a suspicious script, extension or user writable path. Attackers may create or modify Scheduled Tasks for the persistent execution of malicious code.
