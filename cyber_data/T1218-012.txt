Verclsid.exe is known as the Extension CLSID Verification Host and is responsible for verifying each shell extension before they are used by Windows Explorer or the Windows Shell.[1]Adversaries may abuse verclsid.exe to execute malicious payloads. This may be achieved by runningverclsid.exe /S /C {CLSID}, where the file is referenced by a Class ID (CLSID), a unique identification number used to identify COM objects. COM payloads executed by verclsid.exe may be able to perform various malicious actions, such as loading and executing COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers (similar toRegsvr32). Since the binary may be signed and/or native on Windows systems, proxying execution via verclsid.exe may bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse.[2][3][4][5]ID:T1218.012Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationContributors:Rodrigo Garcia, Red CanaryVersion:2.0Created:10 August 2020Last Modified:20 May 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0499HancitorHancitorhas used verclsid.exe to download and execute a malicious script.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider removing verclsid.exe if it is not necessary within a given environment.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control configured to block execution of verclsid.exe if it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.M1037Filter Network TrafficConsider modifying host firewall rules to prevent egress traffic from verclsid.exe.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand arguments used before and after the invocation of verclsid.exe may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the payload being executed.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of verclsid.exe. Compare recent invocations of verclsid.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded files to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. Depending on the environment, it may be unusual for verclsid.exe to have a parent process of a Microsoft Office product. It may also be unusual for verclsid.exe to have any child processes or to make network connections or file modifications.Referencesverclsid-exe.
