Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.[1]Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.Systemd utilizes unit configuration files with the.servicefile extension to encode information about a service's process. By default, system level unit files are stored in the/systemd/systemdirectory of the root owned directories (/). User level unit files are stored in the/systemd/userdirectories of the user owned directories ($HOME).[2]Inside the.serviceunit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:[3]ExecStart,ExecStartPre, andExecStartPostdirectives execute when a service is started manually bysystemctlor on system start if the service is set to automatically start.ExecReloaddirective executes when a service restarts.ExecStop,ExecStopPre, andExecStopPostdirectives execute when a service is stopped.Adversaries have created new service files, altered the commands a.servicefile’s directive executes, and modified the user directive a.servicefile executes as, which could result in privilege escalation. Adversaries may also place symbolic links in these directories, enabling systemd to find these payloads regardless of where they reside on the filesystem.[4][5][6]The .service file’s User directive can be used to run service as a specific user, which could result in privilege escalation based on specific user/group permissions.ID:T1543.002Sub-technique of:T1543ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:LinuxⓘPermissions Required:User, rootContributors:Emad Al-Mousa, Saudi Aramco; Tim (Wadhwa-)Brown; Tony Lambert, Red CanaryVersion:1.5Created:17 January 2020Last Modified:15 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00342022 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamconfigured Systemd to maintain persistence of GOGETTER, specifying theWantedBy=multi-user.targetconfiguration to run GOGETTER when the system begins accepting user logins.[7]S0401Exaramel for LinuxExaramel for Linuxhas a hardcoded location under systemd that it uses to achieve persistence if it is running as root.[8][9]S0410FysbisFysbishas established persistence using a systemd service.[10]S0601HildegardHildegardhas started a monero service.[11]S0192PupyPupycan be used to establish persistence using a systemd service.[12]G0106RockeRockehas installed a systemd service script to maintain persistence.[4]S1078RotaJakiroDepending on the Linux distribution and when executing with root permissions,RotaJakiromay install persistence using a.servicefile under the/lib/systemd/system/folder.[13]S0663SysUpdateSysUpdatecan copy a script to the user owned/usr/lib/systemd/system/directory with a symlink mapped to arootowned directory,/etc/ystem/system, in the unit configuration file'sExecStartdirective to establish persistence and elevate privileges.[14]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas established persistence through the creation of a cryptocurrency mining system service usingsystemctl.[15][16]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1033Limit Software InstallationRestrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages.M1026Privileged Account ManagementThe creation and modification of systemd service unit files is generally reserved for administrators such as the Linux root user and other users with superuser privileges.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsRestrict read/write access to systemd unit files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services.M1018User Account ManagementLimit user access to system utilities such assystemctlto only users who have a legitimate need.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionSuspicious systemd services can also be identified by comparing results against a trusted system baseline. Malicious systemd services may be detected by using the systemctl utility to examine system wide services:systemctl list-units -–type=service –all. Auditing the execution and command-line arguments of the 'systemctl' utility, as well related utilities such as/usr/sbin/servicemay reveal malicious systemd service execution.DS0022FileFile CreationSystemd service unit files may be detected by auditing file creation and modification events within the/etc/systemd/system,/usr/lib/systemd/system/, and/home//.config/systemd/user/directories, as well as associated symbolic linksFile ModificationSystemd service unit files may be detected by auditing file creation and modification events within the/etc/systemd/system,/usr/lib/systemd/system/, and/home//.config/systemd/user/directories, as well as associated symbolic linksDS0009ProcessProcess CreationSuspicious processes or scripts spawned in this manner will have a parent process of ‘systemd’, a parent process ID of 1, and will usually execute as the ‘root’ user.DS0019ServiceService CreationMonitor for new constructed systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.Service ModificationAnalyze the contents of.servicefiles present on the file system and ensure that they refer to legitimate, expected executables.ReferencesLinux man-pages.
