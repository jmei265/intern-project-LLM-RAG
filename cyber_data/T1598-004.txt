Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex:Impersonation) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries use phone calls to elicit sensitive information from victims. Known as voice phishing (or "vishing"), these communications can be manually executed by adversaries, hired call centers, or even automated via robocalls. Voice phishers may spoof their phone number while also posing as a trusted entity, such as a business partner or technical support staff.[1]Victims may also receive phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number ("callback phishing") where the adversary attempts to collect confidential information.[2]Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorSearch Victim-Owned Websites) to tailor pretexts to be even more persuasive and believable for the victim.ID:T1598.004Sub-technique of:T1598ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:07 September 2023Last Modified:08 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spiderused phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites.[3]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has called victims' help desk to convince the support personnel to reset a privileged account’s credentials.[4]G1015Scattered SpiderDuringC0027,Scattered Spiderused phone calls to instruct victims to navigate to credential-harvesting websites.[3]Scattered Spiderhas also called employees at target organizations and compelled them to navigate to fake login portals using adversary-in-the-middle toolkits.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1017User TrainingUsers can be trained to identify and report social engineering techniques and spearphishing attempts, while also being suspicious of and verifying the identify of callers.[6]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor call logs from corporate devices to identify patterns of potential voice phishing, such as calls to/from known malicious phone numbers.ReferencesBank of America.
