Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.[1]Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.Prior toCode Signing, adversaries may purchase or steal code signing certificates for use in operations. The purchase of code signing certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal code signing materials directly from a compromised third-party.ID:T1588.003Sub-technique of:T1588ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:17 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0098BlackTechBlackTechhas used stolen code-signing certificates for its malicious payloads.[2]G1003Ember BearEmber Bearhas stolen legitimate certificates to sign malicious payloads.[3]G0061FIN8FIN8has used an expired open-source X.509 certificate for testing in the OpenSSL repository, to connect to actor-controlled C2 servers.[4]S0576MegaCortexMegaCortexhas used code signing certificates issued to fake companies to bypass security controls.[5]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused code signing certificates issued by Sectigo RSA for some of its malware and tools.[6]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has obtained stolen valid certificates, including from VMProtect and the Chinese instant messaging application Youdu, for their operations.[7]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas obtained code signing certificates signed by DigiCert, GlobalSign, and COMOOD for malware payloads.[8][9]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0004Malware RepositoryMalware MetadataConsider analyzing code signing certificates for features that may be associated with the adversary and/or their developers, such as the thumbprint, algorithm used, validity period, common name, and certificate authority. Malware repositories can also be used to identify additional samples associated with the adversary and identify patterns an adversary has used in procuring code signing certificates.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related follow-on behavior, such asCode SigningorInstall Root Certificate.ReferencesWikipedia. (2015, November 10). Code Signing.
