The majority of native system logging is stored under the/var/log/directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:[1]/var/log/messages:: General and system-related messages/var/log/secureor/var/log/auth.log: Authentication logs/var/log/utmpor/var/log/wtmp: Login records/var/log/kern.log: Kernel logs/var/log/cron.log: Crond logs/var/log/maillog: Mail server logs/var/log/httpd/: Web server access and error logsID:T1070.002Sub-technique of:T1070ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, macOSVersion:1.0Created:28 January 2020Last Modified:29 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1016MacMaMacMacan clear possible malware traces such as application logs.[2]S0279ProtonProtonremoves logs from/var/logsand/Library/logs.[3]G0106RockeRockehas cleared log files within the /var/log/ folder.[4]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas removed system logs from/var/log/syslog.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationObfuscate/encrypt event files locally and in transit to avoid giving feedback to an adversary.M1029Remote Data StorageAutomatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system.
