        "The WooCommerce - Social Login plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.7.3. This is due to insufficient controls in the 'woo_slg_login_email' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, excluding an administrator, if they know the email of user."
