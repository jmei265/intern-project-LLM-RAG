Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such asftp. Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e.Lateral Tool Transfer).On Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such ascopy,finger,certutil, andPowerShellcommands such asIEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString()andInvoke-WebRequest. On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such ascurl,scp,sftp,tftp,rsync,finger, andwget.[1]Adversaries may also abuse installers and package managers, such asyumorwinget, to download tools to victim hosts. Adversaries have also abused file application features, such as the Windowssearch-msprotocol handler, to deliver malicious files to victims through remote file searches invoked byUser Execution(typically after interacting withPhishinglures).[2]Files can also be transferred using variousWeb Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.[3]In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.[4]ID:T1105Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Alain Homewood; Jeremy Hedges; Joe Wise; John Page (aka hyp3rlinx),

malware or unusual data transfer over known protocols like FTP can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.[525]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for suspicious activity associated with downloading external content.DS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for file creation and files transferred into the networkDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts or creating files on-system may be suspicious. Use of utilities, such as FTP, that does not normally occur may also be suspicious.Network Traffic ContentMonitor network traffic content for files and other potentially malicious content, especially data coming in from abnormal/unknown domain and IPs.Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server).
