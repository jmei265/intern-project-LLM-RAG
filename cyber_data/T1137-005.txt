Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages. A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender. Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.[1]Once malicious rules have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.[1]ID:T1137.005Sub-technique of:T1137ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Office 365, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserContributors:Microsoft SecurityVersion:1.1Created:07 November 2019Last Modified:15 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0358RulerRulercan be used to automate the abuse of Outlook Rules to establish persistence.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Office applications from creating child processes and from writing potentially malicious executable content to disk.[3]M1051Update SoftwareFor the Outlook methods, blocking macros may be ineffective as the Visual Basic engine used for these features is separate from the macro scripting engine.[4]Microsoft has released patches to try to address each issue. Ensure KB3191938 which blocks Outlook Visual Basic and displays a malicious code warning, KB4011091 which disables custom forms by default, and KB4011162 which removes the legacy Home Page feature, are applied to systems.[5]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system. SensePost, whose toolRulercan be used to carry out malicious rules, forms, and Home Page attacks, has released a tool to detect Ruler usage.[6]DS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft has released a PowerShell script to safely gather mail forwarding rules and custom forms in your mail environment as well as steps to interpret the output.[7]This PowerShell script is ineffective in gathering rules with modified PR_RULE_MSG_NAME and PR_RULE_MSG_PROVIDER properties caused by adversaries using a Microsoft Exchange Server Messaging API Editor (MAPI Editor), so only examination with the Exchange Administration tool MFCMapi can reveal these mail forwarding rules.[8]DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system.ReferencesLanders, N.
