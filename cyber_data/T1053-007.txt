Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks.[1][2]An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.[3]ID:T1053.007Sub-technique of:T1053ⓘTactics:Execution,Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:ContainersⓘPermissions Required:UserⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID); Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:1.3Created:29 March 2021Last Modified:15 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementEnsure containers are not running as root by default.
