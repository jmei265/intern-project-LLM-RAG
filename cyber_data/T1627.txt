Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include environment information such as location.[1]Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typicalSystem Checks. While use ofSystem Checksmay involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.ID:T1627Sub-techniques:T1627.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1006Use Recent OS VersionNew OS releases frequently contain additional limitations or controls around device location access.M1011User GuidanceUsers should be advised to be extra scrutinous of applications that request location or sensitive phone information permissions, and to deny any permissions requests for applications they do not recognize.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services can detect unnecessary and potentially abused API calls.Permissions RequestsApplication vetting services can detect unnecessary and potentially abused permissions.DS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsThe user can review which applications have location and sensitive phone information permissions in the operating system’s settings menu.ReferencesSecurity Without Borders.
