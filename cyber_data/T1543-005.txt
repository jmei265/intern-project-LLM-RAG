These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.For example, by using thedocker runorpodman runcommand with therestart=alwaysdirective, a container can be configured to persistently restart on the host.[1]A user with access to the (rootful) docker command may also be able to escalate their privileges on the host.[2]In Kubernetes environments, DaemonSets allow an adversary to persistentlyDeploy Containers on all nodes, including ones added later to the cluster.[3][4]Pods can also be deployed to specific nodes using thenodeSelectorornodeNamefields in the pod spec.[5][6]Note that containers can also be configured to run asSystemd Services.[7][8]ID:T1543.005Sub-technique of:T1543ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:ContainersVersion:1.0Created:15 February 2024Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1054Software ConfigurationWhere possible, consider enforcing the use of container services in rootless mode to limit the possibility of privilege escalation or malicious effects on the host running the container.M1018User Account ManagementLimit access to utilities such as docker to only users who have a legitimate need, especially if using docker in rootful mode. In Kubernetes environments, only grant privileges to deploy pods to users that require it.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor for suspicious uses of the docker or podman command, such as attempts to mount the root filesystem of the host.DS0032ContainerContainer CreationMonitor for newly constructed containers that repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence or privilege escalation.ReferencesOfek Itach and Assaf Morag.
