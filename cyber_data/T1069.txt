This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.Adversaries may attempt to discover group permission settings in many different ways. This data may provide the adversary with information about the compromised environment that can be used in follow-on activity and targeting.[1]ID:T1069Sub-techniques:T1069.001,T1069.002,T1069.003ⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Daniel Prizmant, Palo Alto Networks; Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Yuval Avrahami, Palo Alto NetworksVersion:2.5Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:15 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3APT3has a tool that can enumerate the permissions associated with Windows groups.[2]G0096APT41APT41usednet groupcommands to enumerate various Windows user groups and permissions.[3]S0335CarbonCarbonuses thenet groupcommand.[4]G1016FIN13FIN13has enumerated all users and roles from a victim's main treasury system.[5]S0483IcedIDIcedIDhas the ability to identify Workgroup membership.[6]S0233MURKYTOPMURKYTOPhas the capability to retrieve information about groups.[7]S0445ShimRatReporterShimRatReportergathered the local privileges for the infected host.[8]S0623SiloscapeSiloscapechecks for Kubernetes node permissions.[9]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used theGet-ManagementRoleAssignmentPowerShell cmdlet to enumerate Exchange management role assignments through an Exchange Management Shell.[10]G0092TA505TA505has used TinyMet to enumerate members of privileged groups.[11]TA505has also runnet group /domain.[12]S0266TrickBotTrickBotcan identify the groups the user on a compromised host belongs to.[13]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.ReferencesRed Team Labs.
