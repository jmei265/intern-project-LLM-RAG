For example, HTTPS over port 8088[1]or port 587[2]as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.Adversaries may also make changes to victim systems to abuse non-standard ports. For example, Registry keys and other configuration settings can be used to modify protocol and port pairings.[3]ID:T1571Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux,
