Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.[1]The Odbcconf.exe binary may be digitally signed by Microsoft.Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse. Similar toRegsvr32, odbcconf.exe has aREGSVRflag that can be misused to execute DLLs (ex:odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR "C:\Users\Public\file.dll"}).[2][3][4]ID:T1218.008Sub-technique of:T1218ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Application control, Digital Certificate ValidationVersion:2.0Created:24 January 2020Last Modified:11 March 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1039BumblebeeBumblebeecan useodbcconf.exeto run DLLs on targeted hosts.[5]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas usedodbcconfto proxy the execution of malicious DLL files.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramOdbcconf.exe may not be necessary within a given environment.M1038Execution PreventionUse application control configured to block execution of Odbcconf.exe if it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand arguments used before and after the invocation of odbcconf.exe may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the DLL being loaded.DS0011ModuleModule LoadMonitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes. Look for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationUse process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of odbcconf.exe. Compare recent invocations of odbcconf.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity.ReferencesMicrosoft.
