The Windows command shell (cmd) is the primary command prompt on Windows systems. The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. The command prompt can be invoked remotely viaRemote Servicessuch asSSH.[1]Batch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.Adversaries may leveragecmdto execute various commands and payloads. Common uses includecmdto execute a single command, or abusingcmdinteractively with input and output forwarded over a command and control channel.ID:T1059.003Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSupports Remote:YesVersion:1.4Created:09 March 2020Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused thexp_cmdshellcommand in MS-SQL.[2]S00654H RAT4H RAThas the capability to create a remote shell.[3]S0469ABKABKhas the ability to usecmdto run a Portable Executable (PE) on the compromised host.[4]S1028Action RATAction RATcan usecmd.exeto execute commands on an infected host.[5]S0202adbupdadbupdcan run a copy of cmd.exe.[6]G0018admin@338Following exploitation withLOWBALLmalware,admin@338actors created a file containing a list of commands to be executed on the compromised computer.[7]S0045ADVSTORESHELLADVSTORESHELLcan create a remote shell and run a given command.[8][9]S1129AkiraAkiraexecutes from the Windows command line and can take various arguments for execution.[10]S0504AnchorAnchorhas used cmd.exe to run its self deletion routine.[11]G0006APT1APT1has used the Windows command shell to execute commands, and batch scripting to automate execution.[12]G0026APT18APT18uses cmd.exe to execute commands on the victim’s machine.[13][14]G0007APT28AnAPT28loader Trojan uses a cmd.exe and batch script to run its payload.[15]The group has also used macros to execute payloads.[16][17][18][19]G0022APT3AnAPT3downloader uses the Windows command"cmd.exe" /C whoami.

ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse the Windows command shell for execution. Usage of the Windows command shell may be common on administrator, developer, or power user systems depending on job function. If scripting is restricted for normal users, then any attempt to enable scripts running on a system would be considered suspicious. If scripts are not commonly used on a system, but enabled, scripts running out of cycle from patching or other administrator functions are suspicious. Scripts should be captured from the file system when possible to determine their actions and intent.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may abuse the Windows command shell for execution.Note: Try an Analytic by creating a baseline of parent processes ofcmdseen over the last 30 days and a list of parent processes ofcmdseen today. Parent processes in the baseline are removed from the set of parent processes seen today, leaving a list of new parent processes. This analytic attempts to identify suspicious programs spawningcmdby looking for programs that do not normally createcmd.  It is very common for some programs to spawncmdas a subprocess, for example to run batch files or Windows commands. However, many processes don’t routinely launch a command prompt - e.g., Microsoft Outlook. A command prompt being launched from a process that normally doesn’t launch command prompts could be the result of malicious code being injected into that process, or of an attacker replacing a legitimate program with a malicious one.Analytic 1 - Unusual Command Execution(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND CommandLine="cmd.exe" AND (CommandLine REGEXP "./c."
