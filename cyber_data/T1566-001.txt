Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely uponUser Executionto gain execution.[1]Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.ID:T1566.001Sub-technique of:T1566ⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Philip WintherVersion:2.2Created:02 March 2020Last Modified:31 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamobtained their initial foothold into many IT systems using Microsoft Office attachments delivered through phishing emails.[2]G0018admin@338admin@338has sent emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents attached.[3]S0331Agent TeslaThe primary delivered mechanism forAgent Teslais through email phishing messages.[4]G0130Ajax Security TeamAjax Security Teamhas used personalized spearphishing attachments.[5]G0138AndarielAndarielhas conducted spearphishing campaigns that included malicious Word or Excel attachments.[6][7]S0622AppleSeedAppleSeedhas been distributed to victims through malicious e-mail attachments.[8]G0099APT-C-36APT-C-36has used spearphishing emails with password protected RAR attachment to avoid being detected by the email gateway.[9]G0006APT1APT1has sent spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments.[10]G0005APT12APT12has sent emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents and PDFs attached.[11][12]G0073APT19APT19sent spearphishing emails with malicious attachments in RTF and XLSM formats to deliver initial exploits.[13]G0007APT28APT28sent spearphishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office and RAR attachments.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21]G0016APT29APT29has used spearphishing emails with an attachment to deliver files with exploits to initial victims.[22][23][24][25]G0013APT30APT30has used spearphishing emails with malicious DOC attachments.[26]G0050APT32APT32has sent spearphishing emails with a malicious executable disguised as a document or spreadsheet.[27][28][29][30][31][32]G0064APT33APT33has sent spearphishing e-mails with archive attachments.[33]G0067APT37APT37delivers malware using spearphishing emails with malicious HWP attachments.[34][35][36]G0082APT38APT38has conducted spearphishing campaigns using malicious email attachments.[37]G0087APT39APT39leveraged spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to initially compromise victims.[38][39][40]G0096APT41APT41sent spearphishing emails with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise their victims.[41]S0373AstarothAstarothhas been delivered via malicious e-mail attachments.[42]S0642BADFLICKBADFLICKhas been distributed via spearphishing campaigns containing malicious Microsoft Word documents.[43]S0234BandookBandookis delivered via a malicious Word document inside a zip file.[44]S0268BisonalBisonalhas been delivered as malicious email attachments.[45]G1002BITTERBITTERhas sent spearphishing emails with a malicious RTF document or Excel spreadsheet.[46][47]G0098BlackTechBlackTechhas used spearphishing e-mails with malicious password-protected archived files (ZIP or RAR) to deliver malware.[48][49]S0520BLINDINGCANBLINDINGCANhas been delivered by phishing emails containing malicious Microsoft Office documents.[50]G0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERused spearphishing emails with malicious Microsoft Word attachments to infect victims.[51][52]S1039BumblebeeBumblebeehas gained execution through luring users into opening malicious attachments.[53][54][55][56]C0011C0011DuringC0011,Transparent Tribesent malicious attachments via email to student targets in India.[57]C0015C0015ForC0015, security researchers assessed the threat actors likely used a phishing campaign to distribute a weaponized attachment to victims.[58]S0631ChaesChaeshas been delivered by sending victims a phishing email containing a malicious .docx file.[59]S0660ClamblingClamblinghas been delivered to victim's machines through malicious e-mail attachments.[60]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas sent spearphishing emails with various attachment types to corporate and personal email accounts of victim organizations.

intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email attachments can be used to block activity.M1021Restrict Web-Based ContentBlock unknown or unused attachments by default that should not be transmitted over email as a best practice to prevent some vectors, such as .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc. Some email scanning devices can open and analyze compressed and encrypted formats, such as zip and rar that may be used to conceal malicious attachments.M1054Software ConfigurationUse anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM). Enabling these mechanisms within an organization (through policies such as DMARC) may enable recipients (intra-org and cross domain) to perform similar message filtering and validation.[255][256]M1017User TrainingUsers can be trained to identify social engineering techniques and spearphishing emails.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.[255][256]Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Monitor for suspicious descendant process spawning from Microsoft Office and other productivity software.[257]DS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files from a spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze SSL/TLS traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)). Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.[255][256]Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesFalcone, R., et al. (2018, July 27).
