Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.These scans may also include more broad attempts toGather Victim Host Informationthat can be used to identify more commonly known, exploitable vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software and version numbers via server banners, listening ports, or other network artifacts.[1]Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Websites/DomainsorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Develop CapabilitiesorObtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex:Exploit Public-Facing Application).ID:T1595.002Sub-technique of:T1595ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:13 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has performed large-scale scans in an attempt to find vulnerable servers.[2]G0016APT29APT29has conducted widespread scanning of target environments to identify vulnerabilities for exploit.[3]G0096APT41APT41used the Acunetix SQL injection vulnerability scanner in target reconnaissance operations, as well as the JexBoss tool to identify vulnerabilities in Java applications.[4]G0143Aquatic PandaAquatic Pandahas used publicly accessible DNS logging services to identify servers vulnerable to Log4j (CVE 2021-44228).[5]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors used the publicly available Interactsh tool to identify Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs vulnerable to CVE-2024-21893.[6]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas scanned targeted systems for vulnerable Citrix and Microsoft Exchange services.[7]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas scanned for vulnerabilities in the public-facing servers of their targets.[8]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas conducted widespread scanning to identify public-facing systems vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j and ProxyShell vulnerabilities; CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065 in on-premises MS Exchange Servers; and CVE-2018-13379 in Fortinet FortiOS SSL VPNs.[9][10]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas scanned network infrastructure for vulnerabilities as part of its operational planning.[11]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas scanned for vulnerabilities in IoT devices and other related resources such as the Docker API.[12]G0123Volatile CedarVolatile Cedarhas performed vulnerability scans of the target server.[13][14]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesOWASP. (n.d.). OAT-014 Vulnerability Scanning.
