Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.Several types exist:Browser-based ExploitationWeb browsers are a common target throughDrive-by CompromiseandSpearphishing Link. Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.Office ApplicationsCommon office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted throughPhishing. Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.Common Third-party ApplicationsOther applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.ID:T1203Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Remote exploitation for execution requires a remotely accessible service reachable over the network or other vector of access such as spearphishing or drive-by compromise.Version:1.4Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:18 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0018admin@338admin@338has exploited client software vulnerabilities for execution, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158.[1]S0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas exploited Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2017-8570 for execution during delivery.[2]G0138AndarielAndarielhas exploited numerous ActiveX vulnerabilities, including zero-days.[3][4][5]G1007Aoqin DragonAoqin Dragonhas exploited CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2010-3333 for execution against targeted systems.[6]G0005APT12APT12has exploited multiple vulnerabilities for execution, including Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2012-0158) and vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Flash (CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2011-0609, CVE-2011-0611).[7][8]G0007APT28APT28has exploited Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0262 for execution.[9]G0016APT29APT29has used multiple software exploits for common client software, like Microsoft Word, Exchange, and Adobe Reader, to gain code execution.[10][11][12]G0022APT3APT3has exploited the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability CVE-2015-3113 and Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2014-1776.[13][14]G0050APT32APT32has used RTF document that includes an exploit to execute malicious code.

Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in those systems may still exist.[95]M1050Exploit ProtectionSecurity applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior.[96]Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring.[97]Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentDetecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for abnormal process creations, such as a Command and Scripting Interpreter spawning from a potentially exploited application. Also look for other behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of browser or Office processes.Example, it is not expected behavior for print spool service to be executing discovery type processes. However, this is one example and could be any number of native or third party processes that are executing either unusual or unknown (potentially adversary brought) processes.Note:- Analytic 1, look for instances where Office Applications (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint) are launched with suspicious parameters or from unusual locations- Analytic 2, look for abnormal child process creation by Office Applications especially when accompanied by suspicious command-line parametersAnalytic 1 - Office Application Process Execution(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND (Image= "\winword.exe" OR Image= "\excel.exe" OR Image= "\powerpnt.exe") AND (CommandLine= "macro" OR CommandLine= "automation" OR CommandLine= "shellcode") AND ParentCommandLine= "open*"Analytic 2 - Unusual Child Process Creation(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND (ParentImage= "\winword.exe" OR ParentImage= "\excel.exe" OR ParentImage= "\powerpnt.exe") AND (Image != "\system32\" OR Image != "*\program files")ReferencesFireEye Threat Intelligence.
