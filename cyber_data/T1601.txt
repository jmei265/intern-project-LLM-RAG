On such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.To change the operating system, the adversary typically only needs to affect this one file, replacing or modifying it.  This can either be done live in memory during system runtime for immediate effect, or in storage to implement the change on the next boot of the network device.ID:T1601Sub-techniques:T1601.001,T1601.002ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:1.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:22 October 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1046Boot IntegritySome vendors of embedded network devices provide cryptographic signing to ensure the integrity of operating system images at boot time.  Implement where available, following vendor guidelines.[1]M1045Code SigningMany vendors provide digitally signed operating system images to validate the integrity of the software used on their platform.  Make use of this feature where possible in order to prevent and/or detect attempts by adversaries to compromise the system image.[2]M1043Credential Access ProtectionSome embedded network devices are capable of storing passwords for local accounts in either plain-text or encrypted formats.  Ensure that, where available, local passwords are always encrypted, per vendor recommendations.[3]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS.  Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[4]M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[5]M1026Privileged Account ManagementRestrict administrator accounts to as few individuals as possible, following least privilege principles.  Prevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts, particularly between network and non-network platforms, such as servers or endpoints.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile ModificationMost embedded network devices provide a command to print the version of the currently running operating system. Use this command to query the operating system for its version number and compare it to what is expected for the device in question. Because this method may be used in conjunction withPatch System Image, it may be appropriate to also verify the integrity of the vendor provided operating system image file.Compare the checksum of the operating system file with the checksum of a known good copy from a trusted source. Some embedded network device platforms may have the capability to calculate the checksum of the file, while others may not. Even for those platforms that have the capability, it is recommended to download a copy of the file to a trusted computer to calculate the checksum with software that is not compromised.[6]Many vendors of embedded network devices can provide advanced debugging support that will allow them to work with device owners to validate the integrity of the operating system running in memory. If a compromise of the operating system is suspected, contact the vendor technical support and seek such services for a more thorough inspection of the current running system.[7]ReferencesCisco.
