This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open andDeobfuscate/Decode Files or InformationforUser Execution. The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary.[1]Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery.[2]Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.[3]Adversaries may also abuseCommand Obfuscationto obscure commands executed from payloads or directly viaCommand and Scripting Interpreter. Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and application control mechanisms.[4][5][6]ID:T1027Sub-techniques:T1027.001,T1027.002,T1027.003,T1027.004,T1027.005,T1027.006,T1027.007,T1027.008,T1027.009,T1027.010,T1027.011,T1027.012,T1027.013ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Application Control, Host Forensic Analysis, Host Intrusion Prevention Systems, Log Analysis, Signature-based DetectionContributors:Christiaan Beek, @ChristiaanBeek; Red CanaryVersion:1.6Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused heavily obfuscated code withIndustroyerin its Windows Notepad backdoor.[7]S1028Action RATAction RAT's commands, strings, and domains can be Base64 encoded within the payload.[8]S0045ADVSTORESHELLMost of the strings inADVSTORESHELLare encrypted with an XOR-based algorithm; some strings are also encrypted with 3DES and reversed.
