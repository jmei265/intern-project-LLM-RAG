In earlier versions of Android, device administrator applications needed their administration capabilities explicitly deactivated by the user before the application could be uninstalled. This was later updated so the user could deactivate and uninstall the administrator application in one step.Adversaries may also abuse the device accessibility APIs to prevent removal. This set of APIs allows the application to perform certain actions on behalf of the user and programmatically determine what is being shown on the screen. The malicious application could monitor the device screen for certain modals (e.g., the confirmation modal to uninstall an application) and inject screen input or a back button tap to close the modal. For example, Android'sperformGlobalAction(int)API could be utilized to prevent the user from removing the malicious application from the device after installation. If the user wants to uninstall the malicious application, two cases may occur, both preventing the user from removing the application.Case 1: If the integer argument passed to the API call is2orGLOBAL_ACTION_HOME, the malicious application may direct the user to the home screen from settings screenCase 2: If the integer argument passed to the API call is1orGLOBAL_ACTION_BACK, the malicious application may emulate the back press eventID:T1629.001Sub-technique of:T1629Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:AndroidⓘMTC ID:APP-22Contributors:Shankar Raman, Gen Digital and Abhinand, Amrita UniversityVersion:1.2Created:01 April 2022Last Modified:28 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0422AnubisAnubismay prevent malware's uninstallation by abusing Android’sperformGlobalAction(int)API call.S1083ChameleonChameleoncan prevent application removal by abusing Accessibility Services.[1]S1067FluBotFluBotcan use Accessibility Services to make removal of the malicious app difficult.[2]S0406GustuffGustuffmay prevent application removal by abusing Android’sperformGlobalAction(int)API call.S0485MandrakeMandrakecan abuse device administrator permissions to ensure that it cannot be uninstalled until its permissions are revoked.[3]S0286OBADOBADabuses device administrator access to make it more difficult for users to remove the application.[4]S1062S.O.V.A.S.O.V.A.can resist removal by going to the home screen during uninstall.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1012Enterprise PolicyAn EMM/MDM can use the AndroidDevicePolicyManager.setPermittedAccessibilityServicesmethod to set an explicit list of applications that are allowed to use Android's accessibility features.M1006Use Recent OS VersionRecent versions of Android modified how device administrator applications are uninstalled, making it easier for the user to remove them.M1011User GuidanceUsers should be warned against granting access to accessibility features and device administration services, and to carefully scrutinize applications that request these dangerous permissions. Users should be taught how to boot into safe mode to uninstall malicious applications that may be interfering with the uninstallation process.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services may detect API calls toperformGlobalAction(int).DS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsThe user can view a list of device administrators and applications that have registered accessibility services in device settings. The user can typically visually see when an action happens that they did not initiate and can subsequently review installed applications for any out of place or unknown ones. Applications that register an accessibility service or request device administrator permissions should be scrutinized further for malicious behavior.ReferencesCyble Research & Intelligence Labs.
