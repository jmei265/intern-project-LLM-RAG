Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.[1]Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.[2]The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.[3]ID:T1078Sub-techniques:T1078.001,T1078.002,T1078.003,T1078.004ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Persistence,Privilege Escalation,Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserⓘEffective Permissions:Administrator, UserⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Application Control, Firewall, Host Intrusion Prevention Systems, Network Intrusion Detection System, System Access ControlsContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Jon Sternstein, Stern Security; Mark Wee; Netskope; Praetorian; Prasad Somasamudram, McAfee; Sekhar Sarukkai, McAfee; Syed Ummar Farooqh, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:2.6Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00282015 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused valid accounts on the corporate network to escalate privileges, move laterally, and establish persistence within the corporate network.[4]G1024AkiraAkirauses valid account information to remotely access victim networks, such as VPN credentials.[5][6]G0026APT18APT18actors leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.[7]G0007APT28APT28has used legitimate credentials to gain initial access, maintain access, and exfiltrate data from a victim network.

(e.g. plaintext credentials in code, published credentials in repositories, or credentials in public cloud storage).M1027Password PoliciesApplications and appliances that utilize default username and password should be changed immediately after the installation, and before deployment to a production environment.[72]When possible, applications that use SSH keys should be updated periodically and properly secured.Policies should minimize (if not eliminate) reuse of passwords between different user accounts, especially employees using the same credentials for personal accounts that may not be defended by enterprise security resources.M1026Privileged Account ManagementAudit domain and local accounts as well as their permission levels routinely to look for situations that could allow an adversary to gain wide access by obtaining credentials of a privileged account.[3][73]These audits should also include if default accounts have been enabled, or if new local accounts are created that have not be authorized. Follow best practices for design and administration of an enterprise network to limit privileged account use across administrative tiers.[74]M1018User Account ManagementRegularly audit user accounts for activity and deactivate or remove any that are no longer needed.M1017User TrainingApplications may send push notifications to verify a login as a form of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Train users to only accept valid push notifications and to report suspicious push notifications.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).Logon Session MetadataLook for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for an attempt by a user that may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion.ReferencesAdair, S., Lancaster, T., Volexity Threat Research.
