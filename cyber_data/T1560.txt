Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network.[1]Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender.Both compression and encryption are done prior to exfiltration, and can be performed using a utility, 3rd party library, or custom method.ID:T1560Sub-techniques:T1560.001,T1560.002,T1560.003ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:20 February 2020Last Modified:20 January 2024Version
