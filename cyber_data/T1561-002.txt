If this information is not present, the computer will not be able to load an operating system during the boot process, leaving the computer unavailable.Disk Structure Wipemay be performed in isolation, or along withDisk Content Wipeif all sectors of a disk are wiped.On a network devices, adversaries may reformat the file system usingNetwork Device CLIcommands such asformat.[6]To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for destroying disk structures may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other techniques likeValid Accounts,OS Credential Dumping, andSMB/Windows Admin Shares.[1][2][3][4]ID:T1561.002Sub-technique of:T1561ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defenseVersion:1.1Created:20 February 2020Last Modified:14 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0067APT37APT37has access to destructive malware that is capable of overwriting a machine's Master Boot Record (MBR).[7][8]G0082APT38APT38has used a custom MBR wiper named BOOTWRECK to render systems inoperable.[9]S0693CaddyWiperCaddyWiperhas the ability to destroy information about a physical drive's partitions including the MBR, GPT, and partition entries.[10][11]S0697HermeticWiperHermeticWiperhas the ability to corrupt disk partitions, damage the Master Boot Record (MBR), and overwrite the Master File Table (MFT) of all available physical drives.[12][13][14][15]S0607KillDiskKillDiskoverwrites the first sector of the Master Boot Record with "0x00".[16]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Groupmalware SHARPKNOT overwrites and deletes the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the victim's machine and has possessed MBR wiper malware since at least 2009.[17][18]S0364RawDiskRawDiskwas used inShamoonto help overwrite components of disk structure like the MBR and disk partitions.[3][5]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas used theBlackEnergyKillDisk component to corrupt the infected system's master boot record.[19][20]S0140ShamoonShamoonhas been seen overwriting features of disk structure such as the MBR.[1][2][3][5]S0380StoneDrillStoneDrillcan wipe the master boot record of an infected computer.[21]S0689WhisperGateWhisperGatecan overwrite the Master Book Record (MBR) on victim systems with a malicious 16-bit bootloader.[22][23][24][25][26][27]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1053Data BackupConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.[28]Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups to prevent recovery.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.DS0016DriveDrive AccessMonitor for newly constructed drive letters or mount points to a data storage device for attempts to write to sensitive locations like the partition boot sector, master boot record, disk partition table, or BIOS parameter block/superblock.Drive ModificationMonitor for changes made to drive letters or mount points of data storage devices for attempts to read to sensitive locations like the partition boot sector, master boot record, disk partition table, or BIOS parameter block/superblock.DS0027DriverDriver LoadMonitor for unusual kernel driver installation activity may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.ReferencesSymantec.
