Downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a system’s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation.Adversaries may downgrade and use various less-secure versions of features of a system, such asCommand and Scripting Interpreters or even network protocols that can be abused to enableAdversary-in-the-MiddleorNetwork Sniffing.[1]For example,PowerShellversions 5+ includes Script Block Logging (SBL) which can record executed script content. However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent toImpair Defenseswhile running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected.[2][3][4]Adversaries may similarly target network traffic to downgrade from an encrypted HTTPS connection to an unsecured HTTP connection that exposes network data in clear text.[5][6]ID:T1562.010Sub-technique of:T1562ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Arad Inbar, Fidelis Security; Daniel Feichter, @VirtualAllocEx, Infosec Tirol; Mayuresh Dani, QualysVersion:1.2Created:08 October 2021Last Modified:03 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider removing previous versions of tools that are unnecessary to the environment when possible.M1054Software ConfigurationConsider implementing policies on internal web servers, such HTTP Strict Transport Security, that enforce the use of HTTPS/network traffic encryption to prevent insecure connections.[7]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor for commands or other activity that may be indicative of attempts to abuse older or deprecated technologies (ex:powershell –v 2).DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as logging.Process MetadataMonitor contextual data about a running process, which may include information such as environment variables, image name, user/owner, or other information that may reveal use of a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as logging. For example, monitoring for Windows event ID (EID) 400, specifically theEngineVersionfield which shows the version of PowerShell running, may highlight a malicious downgrade attack.[8]ReferencesPraetorian.
