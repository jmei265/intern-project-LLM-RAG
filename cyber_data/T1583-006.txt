A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control (Web Service),Exfiltration Over Web Service, orPhishing. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise.[1]By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.ID:T1583.006Sub-technique of:T1583ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Dor Edry, MicrosoftVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:16 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0025APT17APT17has created profile pages in Microsoft TechNet that were used as C2 infrastructure.[2]G0007APT28APT28has used newly-created Blogspot pages for credential harvesting operations.[3]G0016APT29APT29has registered algorithmically generated Twitter handles that are used for C2 by malware, such asHAMMERTOSS.APT29has also used legitimate web services such as Dropbox and Constant Contact in their operations.[1][4]G0050APT32APT32has set up Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive to host malicious downloads.[5]G0142ConfuciusConfuciushas obtained cloud storage service accounts to host stolen data.[6]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas established GitHub accounts to host their malware.[7]G0046FIN7FIN7has set up Amazon S3 buckets to host trojanized digital products.[8]G0125HAFNIUMHAFNIUMhas acquired web services for use in C2 and exfiltration.[9]G0136IndigoZebraIndigoZebracreated Dropbox accounts for their operations.[10][11]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas hosted content used for targeting efforts via web services such as Blogspot.[12]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas hosted malicious downloads on Github.[13]G0140LazyScripterLazyScripterhas established GitHub accounts to host its toolsets.[14]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas acquired Amazon S3 buckets to use in C2.[15]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas used file sharing services including OneHub, Sync, and TeraBox to distribute tools.[16][17][18]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused file hosting services like DropBox and OneDrive.[19]C0013Operation SharpshooterForOperation Sharpshooter, the threat actors used Dropbox to host lure documents and their first-stage downloader.[20]G1005POLONIUMPOLONIUMhas created and used legitimate Microsoft OneDrive accounts for their operations.[21]G1018TA2541TA2541has hosted malicious files on various platforms including Google Drive, OneDrive, Discord, PasteText, ShareText, and GitHub.[22]G0010TurlaTurlahas created web accounts including Dropbox and GitHub for C2 and document exfiltration.[23]G0128ZIRCONIUMZIRCONIUMhas used GitHub to host malware linked in spearphishing e-mails.[24][25]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries leverage the web service as infrastructure (ex: for command and control), it may be possible to look for unique characteristics associated with adversary software, if known.[26]Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control (Web Service) orExfiltration Over Web Service.ReferencesFireEye Labs. (2015, July).
