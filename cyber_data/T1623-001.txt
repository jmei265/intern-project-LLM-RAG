Unix shells are the underlying command prompts on Android and iOS devices. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges that are only accessible if the device has been rooted or jailbroken.Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH. Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, adversaries may locate and invoke a superuser binary to elevate their privileges and interact with the system as the root user. This dangerous level of permissions allows the adversary to run special commands and modify protected system files.ID:T1623.001Sub-technique of:T1623Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.2Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:07 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmuhas included encoded shell scripts to potentially aid in the rooting process.[1]S0655BusyGasperBusyGaspercan run shell commands.[2]S0555CHEMISTGAMESCHEMISTGAMEScan run bash commands.[3]S0550DoubleAgentDoubleAgentcan run arbitrary shell commands.[4]S0544HenBoxHenBoxcan run commands as root.[5]S1082SunbirdSunbirdcan try to run arbitrary commands as root.[6]S0558Tiktok ProTiktok Procan execute commands .[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation can often detect jailbroken or rooted devices.M1010Deploy Compromised Device Detection MethodMobile security products can typically detect jailbroken or rooted devices.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could detect the invocations of methods that could be used to execute shell commands.[8]DS0017CommandCommand ExecutionCommand-line activities can potentially be detected through Mobile Threat Defense (MTD) integrations with lower-level OS APIs.
