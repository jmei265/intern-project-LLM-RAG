Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.[1]Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros[2]can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded.[3][4]Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.[5]Word Normal.dotm location:C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotmExcel Personal.xlsb location:C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSBAdversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g. Word 2016 will first look for Normal.dotm underC:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\, or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key. By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup. To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location.[5]An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.ID:T1137.001Sub-technique of:T1137ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Office 365, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, UserVersion:1.1Created:07 November 2019Last Modified:16 August 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0475BackConfigBackConfighas the ability to use hidden columns in Excel spreadsheets to store executable files or commands for VBA macros.[6]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikehas the ability to use an Excel Workbook to execute additional code by enabling Office to trust macros and execute code without user permission.[7]G0069MuddyWaterMuddyWaterhas used a Word Template, Normal.dotm, for persistence.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1040Behavior Prevention on EndpointOn Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Office applications from creating child processes and from writing potentially malicious executable content to disk.[9]M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramFollow Office macro security best practices suitable for your environment. Disable Office VBA macros from executing.Disable Office add-ins. If they are required, follow best practices for securing them by requiring them to be signed and disabling user notification for allowing add-ins. For some add-ins types (WLL, VBA) additional mitigation is likely required as disabling add-ins in the Office Trust Center does not disable WLL nor does it prevent VBA code from executing.[10]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.DS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files that may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.File ModificationMonitor for changes made to files that may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
