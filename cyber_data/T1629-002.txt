This is typically accomplished by requesting device administrator permissions and then locking the screen usingDevicePolicyManager.lockNow(). Other novel techniques for locking the user out of the device have been observed, such as showing a persistent overlay, using carefully crafted "call" notification screens, and locking HTML pages in the foreground. These techniques can be very difficult to get around, and typically require booting the device into safe mode to uninstall the malware.[1][2][3]Prior to Android 7, device administrators were able to reset the device lock passcode to prevent the user from unlocking the device. The release of Android 7 introduced updates that only allow device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) to reset the device’s passcode.[4]ID:T1629.002Sub-technique of:T1629Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:AndroidⓘMTC ID:APP-22Version:1.1Created:01 April 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0524AndroidOS/MalLocker.BAndroidOS/MalLocker.Bcan prevent the user from interacting with the UI by using a carefully crafted "call" notification screen.

Android 7 introduced updates that revoke standard device administrators’ ability to reset the device’s passcode.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0042User InterfaceSystem SettingsThe user can view a list of device administrators in device settings and revoke permission where appropriate. Applications that request device administrator permissions should be scrutinized further for malicious behavior.ReferencesD. Venkatesan. (2020, October 8).
