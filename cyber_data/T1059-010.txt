AutoIT and AutoHotkey (AHK) are scripting languages that enable users to automate Windows tasks. These automation scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text, and opening and closing programs.[1][2]Adversaries may use AHK (.ahk) and AutoIT (.au3) scripts to execute malicious code on a victim's system. For example, adversaries have used for AHK to execute payloads and other modular malware such as keyloggers. Adversaries have also used custom AHK files containing embedded malware asPhishingpayloads.[3]These scripts may also be compiled into self-contained executable payloads (.exe).[1][2]ID:T1059.010Sub-technique of:T1059ⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:WindowsContributors:@_montysecurity; Liran Ravich, CardinalOps; Rahmat Nurfauzi, @infosecn1nja, PT Xynexis International; Serhii Melnyk, Trustwave SpiderLabs; TruKnoVersion:1.0Created:29 March 2024Last Modified:28 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0087APT39APT39has utilized AutoIt malware scripts embedded in Microsoft Office documents or malicious links.[4]S1111DarkGateDarkGateuses AutoIt scripts dropped to a hidden directory during initial installation phases, such astest.au3.[5]S0530MelcozMelcozhas been distributed through an AutoIt loader script.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionUse application control to prevent execution ofAutoIt3.exe,AutoHotkey.exe, and other related features that may not be required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for abnormal usage of utilities and command-line arguments that may be used in support of malicious execution.
