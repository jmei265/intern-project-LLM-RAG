Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as inDrive-by Compromise. In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such asApplication Access Token. Prior toDrive-by Compromise, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired (Acquire Infrastructure) or previously compromised (Compromise Infrastructure).Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such asJavaScript, into websites.[1][2]This may be done in a number of ways, including:Inserting malicious scripts into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum postsModifying script files served to websites from publicly writeable cloud storage bucketsCrafting malicious web advertisements and purchasing ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers (i.e.,Malvertising)In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as inGather Victim Host Information) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation.[3]Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure (Domains) to help facilitateDrive-by Compromise.ID:T1608.004Sub-technique of:T1608ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.3Created:17 March 2021Last Modified:15 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0050APT32APT32has stood up websites containing numerous articles and content scraped from the Internet to make them appear legitimate, but some of these pages include malicious JavaScript to profile the potential victim or infect them via a fake software update.[4]C0010C0010ForC0010, the threat actors compromised the login page of a legitimate Israeli shipping company and likely established a watering hole that collected visitor information.[5]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas compromised websites to redirect traffic and to host exploit kits.[6]G0046FIN7FIN7has compromised a digital product website and modified multiple download links to point to trojanized versions of offered digital products.[7]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas redirected compromised machines to an actor-controlled webpage through HTML injection.[8]G1020Mustard TempestMustard Tempesthas injected malicious JavaScript into compromised websites to infect victims via drive-by download.[9][10][11][12]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has embedded malicious code into websites to screen a potential victim's IP address and then exploit their browser if they are of interest.[2]G0134Transparent TribeTransparent Tribehas set up websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims withCrimson,njRAT, and other malicious tools.[13][14][15]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentIf infrastructure or patterns in the malicious web content utilized to deliver aDrive-by Compromisehave been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged web content for use in a strategic web compromise.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such asDrive-by CompromiseorExploitation for Client Execution.ReferencesKindlund, D. (2012, December 30).
