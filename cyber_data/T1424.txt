Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on devices within a network. Adversaries may use the information fromProcess Discoveryduring automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Recent Android security enhancements have made it more difficult to obtain a list of running processes. On Android 7 and later, there is no way for an application to obtain the process list without abusing elevated privileges. This is due to the Android kernel utilizing thehidepidmount feature. Prior to Android 7, applications could utilize thepscommand or examine the/procdirectory on the device.[1]In iOS, applications have previously been able to use thesysctlcommand to obtain a list of running processes. This functionality has been removed in later iOS versions.ID:T1424Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:2.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0440Agent SmithAgent Smithchecks if a targeted application is running in user-space prior to infection.[2]S0422AnubisAnubiscan collect a list of running processes.[3]S0421GolfSpyGolfSpycan obtain a list of running processes.[4]S0544HenBoxHenBoxcan obtain a list of running processes.[5]S0411RotexyRotexycollects information about running processes.[6]S1055SharkBotSharkBotcan use Accessibility Services to detect which process is in the foreground.[7]S0489WolfRATWolfRATusesdumpsysto determine if certain applications are running.[8]S0311YiSpecterYiSpecterhas collected information about running processes.[9]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationAttestation can typically detect rooted devices.

Application vetting could potentially detect when applications attempt to abuse root access or root the system itself. Further, application vetting services could look for attempted usage of legacy process discovery mechanisms, such as the usage ofpsor inspection of the/procdirectory.ReferencesVarious.
