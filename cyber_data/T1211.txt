Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.Adversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised forSecurity Software Discovery. The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection.There have also been examples of vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure of SaaS applications that may bypass defense boundaries[1], evade security logs[2], or deploy hidden infrastructure.[3]ID:T1211Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, System access controlsContributors:John Lambert, Microsoft Threat Intelligence CenterVersion:1.4Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:15 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used CVE-2015-4902 to bypass security features.[4][5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1048Application Isolation and SandboxingMake it difficult for adversaries to advance their operation through exploitation of undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities by using sandboxing. Other types of virtualization and application microsegmentation may also mitigate the impact of some types of exploitation. Risks of additional exploits and weaknesses in these systems may still exist.[6]M1050Exploit ProtectionSecurity applications that look for behavior used during exploitation such as Windows Defender Exploit Guard (WDEG) and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used to mitigate some exploitation behavior.[7]Control flow integrity checking is another way to potentially identify and stop a software exploit from occurring.[8]Many of these protections depend on the architecture and target application binary for compatibility and may not work for software targeted for defense evasion.M1019Threat Intelligence ProgramDevelop a robust cyber threat intelligence capability to determine what types and levels of threat may use software exploits and 0-days against a particular organization.M1051Update SoftwareUpdate software regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and servers.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentExploitation for defense evasion may happen shortly after the system has been compromised to prevent detection during later actions for for additional tools that may be brought in and used. Detecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for abnormal process creations, such as a Command and Scripting Interpreter spawning from a potentially exploited application. Also look for behavior on the system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of processes.ReferencesBill Toulas. (2023, August 2).
