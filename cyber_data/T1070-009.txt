This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables,Modify Registry,Plist File Modification, or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.[1]Adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e.Create Account).[2]In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary’s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.[3]ID:T1070.009Sub-technique of:T1070ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Gavin KnappVersion:1.1Created:29 July 2022Last Modified:11 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0534BazarBazar's loader can delete scheduled tasks created by a previous instance of the malware.[3]S0632GrimAgentGrimAgentcan delete previously created tasks on a compromised host.[4]S0669KOCTOPUSKOCTOPUScan delete created registry keys used for persistence as part of its cleanup procedure.[5]S0500MCMDMCMDhas the ability to remove set Registry Keys, including those used for persistence.[6]S0083MisdatMisdatis capable of deleting Registry keys used for persistence.[1]S0385njRATnjRATis capable of manipulating and deleting registry keys, including those used for persistence.[7]S0517PillowmintPillowmintcan uninstall the malicious service from an infected machine.[8]S0148RTMRTMhas the ability to remove Registry entries that it created for persistence.[9]S0085S-TypeS-Typehas deleted accounts it has created.[1]S0559SUNBURSTSUNBURSTremoved IFEO registry values to clean up traces of persistence.[10]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1029Remote Data StorageAutomatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system. When possible, minimize time delay on event reporting to avoid prolonged storage on the local system.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsProtect generated event files that are stored locally with proper permissions and authentication and limit opportunities for adversaries to increase privileges by preventing Privilege Escalation opportunities.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.DS0022FileFile DeletionMonitor for a file that may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.File ModificationMonitor for changes made to a file may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.DS0003Scheduled JobScheduled Job ModificationMonitor for changes made to scheduled jobs that may attempt to remove artifacts on a host system.DS0002User AccountUser Account DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may highlight activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (e.g.,Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate account modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key DeletionMonitor windows registry keys that may be deleted or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.Windows Registry Key ModificationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys or values that may delete or alter generated artifacts associated with persistence on a host system.ReferencesGross, J.
