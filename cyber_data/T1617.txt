Hooking can be used to modify return values or data structures of system APIs and function calls. This process typically involves using 3rd party root frameworks, such as Xposed or Magisk, with either a system exploit or pre-existing root access. By including custom modules for root frameworks, adversaries can hook system APIs and alter the return value and/or system data structures to alter functionality/visibility of various aspects of the system.ID:T1617Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:AndroidContributors:Jörg Abraham, EclecticIQVersion:1.0Created:24 September 2021Last Modified:24 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0407MonokleMonoklecan hook itself to appear invisible to the Process Manager.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation can often detect rooted devices.M1010Deploy Compromised Device Detection MethodMobile security products can often detect rooted devices.DetectionHooking can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.ReferencesBauer A., Kumar A., Hebeisen C., et al.
