Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.[1][2]Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen throughCredential Accesstechniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors.ID:T1550Sub-techniques:T1550.001,T1550.002,T1550.003,T1550.004ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaS, WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:System Access ControlsContributors:Blake Strom, Microsoft Threat Intelligence; Pawel Partyka, Microsoft Threat IntelligenceVersion:1.3Created:30 January 2020Last Modified:28 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0661FoggyWebFoggyWebcan allow abuse of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token.[3]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enablingAPT29to access enterprise cloud applications and services.[4][5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1015Active Directory ConfigurationConfigure Active Directory to prevent use of certain techniques; use SID Filtering, etc.M1013Application Developer GuidanceConsider implementing token binding strategies, such as Azure AD token protection or OAuth Proof of Possession, that cryptographically bind a token to a secret. This may prevent the token from being used without knowledge of the secret or possession of the device the token is tied to.[6][7]M1047AuditPerform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses.M1027Password PoliciesSet and enforce secure password policies for accounts.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit credential overlap across systems to prevent the damage of credential compromise and reduce the adversary's ability to perform Lateral Movement between systems.M1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege. Do not allow a domain user to be in the local administrator group on multiple systems.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0026Active DirectoryActive Directory Credential RequestMonitor requests of new ticket granting ticket or service tickets to a Domain Controller, such as Windows EID 4769 or 4768, that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.DS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationLook for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.DS0006Web CredentialWeb Credential UsageMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource by providing web credentials (ex: Windows EID 1202) that may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.ReferencesNIST.
