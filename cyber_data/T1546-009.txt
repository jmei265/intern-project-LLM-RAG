Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in theAppCertDLLsRegistry key underHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functionsCreateProcess,CreateProcessAsUser,CreateProcessWithLoginW,CreateProcessWithTokenW, orWinExec.[1]Similar toProcess Injection, this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer. Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.ID:T1546.009Sub-technique of:T1546ⓘTactics:Privilege Escalation,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEMⓘEffective Permissions:Administrator, SYSTEMVersion:1.0Created:24 January 2020Last Modified:10 November 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0196PUNCHBUGGYPUNCHBUGGYcan establish using a AppCertDLLs Registry key.[2]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1038Execution PreventionAdversaries install new AppCertDLL binaries to execute this technique.
