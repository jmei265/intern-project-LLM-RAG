Information about network trusts may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains (ex: managed service providers, contractors, etc.) that have connected (and potentially elevated) network access.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation viaPhishing for Information. Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Search Open Technical Databases).[1]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Active ScanningorSearch Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex:Acquire InfrastructureorCompromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex:Trusted Relationship).ID:T1590.003Sub-technique of:T1590ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesGarcía, C.
