During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex:Application Layer Protocol). Instead of setting up their own DNS servers, adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers in support of operations.By compromising DNS servers, adversaries can alter DNS records. Such control can allow for redirection of an organization's traffic, facilitating Collection and Credential Access efforts for the adversary.[1][2]Additionally, adversaries may leverage such control in conjunction withDigital Certificatesto redirect traffic to adversary-controlled infrastructure, mimicking normal trusted network communications.[2][3]Adversaries may also be able to silently create subdomains pointed at malicious servers without tipping off the actual owner of the DNS server.[4][5]ID:T1584.002Sub-technique of:T1584ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Jeremy GallowayVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:19 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has reconfigured a victim's DNS records to actor-controlled domains and websites.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0038Domain NameActive DNSMonitor for queried domain name system (DNS) registry data that may compromise third-party DNS servers that can be used during targeting.
