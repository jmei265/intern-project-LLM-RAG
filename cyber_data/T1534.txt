Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporatingImpersonation.[1]For example, adversaries may leverageSpearphishing AttachmentorSpearphishing Linkas part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials throughInput Captureon sites that mimic login interfaces.Adversaries may also leverage internal chat apps, such as Microsoft Teams, to spread malicious content or engage users in attempts to capture sensitive information and/or credentials.[2]ID:T1534Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Google Workspace, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Swetha Prabakaran, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Tim MalcomVetterVersion:1.3Created:04 September 2019Last Modified:16 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas used an Outlook VBA module on infected systems to send phishing emails with malicious attachments to other employees within the organization.[3]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas conducted internal spearphishing attacks against executives, HR, and IT personnel to gain information and access.[4]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas sent internal spearphishing emails for lateral movement after stealing victim information.[5]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas conducted internal spearphishing within the victim's environment for lateral movement.[6]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupconducted internal spearphishing from within a compromised organization.[7]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesTrend Micro. (n.d.).
