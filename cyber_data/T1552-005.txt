Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.[1]A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high profile compromise.[2]If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources. Additionally, adversaries may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows them to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.[3]The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API athttp[:]//169.254.169.254.ID:T1552.005Sub-technique of:T1552ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:IaaSContributors:PraetorianVersion:1.4Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:21 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0601HildegardHildegardhas queried the Cloud Instance Metadata API for cloud credentials.[4]S0683PeiratesPeiratescan query the query AWS and GCP metadata APIs for secrets.[5]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas queried the AWS instance metadata service for credentials.[6][7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramDisable unnecessary metadata services and restrict or disable insecure versions of metadata services that are in use to prevent adversary access.[8]M1037Filter Network TrafficLimit access to the Instance Metadata API.
