Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.  Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency, specifically with the widespread usage of third-party advertising libraries.[1][2]ID:T1474Sub-techniques:T1474.001,T1474.002,T1474.003Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-6,SPC-0,SPC-1,SPC-2,SPC-3,SPC-4,SPC-5,SPC-6,SPC-7,SPC-8,SPC-9,SPC-10,SPC-11,SPC-12,SPC-13,SPC-14,SPC-15,SPC-16,SPC-17,SPC-18,SPC-19,SPC-20,SPC-21Version:2.1Created:17 October 2018Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1013Application Developer GuidanceApplication developers should be cautious when selecting third-party libraries to integrate into their application.M1001Security UpdatesSecurity updates may contain patches for devices that were compromised at the supply chain level.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsUsage of insecure or malicious third-party libraries could be detected by application vetting services. Malicious software development tools could be detected by enterprises that deploy endpoint protection software on computers that are used to develop mobile apps. Application vetting could detect the usage of insecure or malicious third-party libraries.ReferencesM. Grace et al. (2012, April 16-18). Unsafe exposure analysis of mobile in-app advertisements.
