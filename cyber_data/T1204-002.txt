Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior fromSpearphishing Attachment. Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.Adversaries may employ various forms ofMasqueradingandObfuscated Files or Informationto increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file. These methods may include using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.[1]WhileMalicious Filefrequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it.

Note: cloud-delivered protection must be enabled for certain rules.[274]M1038Execution PreventionApplication control may be able to prevent the running of executables masquerading as other files.M1017User TrainingUse user training as a way to bring awareness to common phishing and spearphishing techniques and how to raise suspicion for potentially malicious events.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files that are downloaded and executed on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning powershell.exe).While batch files are not inherently malicious, it is uncommon to see them created after OS installation, especially in the Windows directory. This analytic looks for the suspicious activity of a batch file being created within the C:\Windows\System32 directory tree. There will be only occasional false positives due to administrator actions.For Windows, Sysmon Event ID 11 (File create) can be used to track file creation events. This event also provides the Process ID of the process that created the file, which can be correlated with process creation events (e.g., Sysmon Event ID 1) to determine if the file was downloaded from an external network.For MacOS, utilities that work in concert with Apple’s Endpoint Security Framework such as File Monitor can be used to track file creation events.Analytic 1 - Batch File Write to System32(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="11") file_path="system32*" AND file_extension=".bat"DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines for applications that may be used by an adversary to gain initial access that require user interaction.
