Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It usesShortcut Modificationof directory .LNK files that useMasqueradingto look like the real directories, which are hidden throughHidden Files and Directories. The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts.[1]Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.ID:T1080Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:Access to shared folders and content with write permissionsContributors:David Routin; Michal Dida, ESETVersion:1.4Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:31 May 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0060BRONZE BUTLERBRONZE BUTLERhas placed malware on file shares and given it the same name as legitimate documents on the share.[2]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas deployed ransomware from a batch file in a network share.[3]S0575ContiContican spread itself by infecting other remote machines via network shared drives.[4][5]G0012DarkhotelDarkhotelused a virus that propagates by infecting executables stored on shared drives.[6]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents on mapped network drives.[7]S0132H1N1H1N1has functionality to copy itself to network shares.[8]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan replace legitimate software or documents in the compromised network with their trojanized versions, in an attempt to propagate itself within the network.[9]S0133Miner-CMiner-Ccopies itself into the public folder of Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices and infects new victims who open the file.[10]S0458RamsayRamsaycan spread itself by infecting other portable executable files on networks shared drives.[11]S0603StuxnetStuxnetinfects remote servers via network shares and by infecting WinCC database views with malicious code.[12]S0386UrsnifUrsnifhas copied itself to and infected files in network drives for propagation.[13][14]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1049Antivirus/AntimalwareAnti-virus can be used to automatically quarantine suspicious files.[15]M1038Execution PreventionIdentify potentially malicious software that may be used to taint content or may result from it and audit and/or block the unknown programs by using application control[16]tools, like AppLocker,[17][18]or Software Restriction Policies[19]where appropriate.[20]M1050Exploit ProtectionUse utilities that detect or mitigate common features used in exploitation, such as the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsProtect shared folders by minimizing users who have write access.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files from files that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious.File ModificationMonitor for files that write or overwrite many files to a network shared directory may be suspicious.DS0033Network ShareNetwork Share AccessMonitor for unexpected and abnormal accesses to network shares, especially those also associated with file activity.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor processes that are executed from removable media for malicious or abnormal activity such as network connections due to Command and Control and possible network Discovery techniques.ReferencesRoutin, D.
