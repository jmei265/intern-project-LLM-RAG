These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc. They may also include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment. Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity.[1][2]For example, Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services.[3][4]Adversaries may use the information gained to shape follow-on behaviors, such as targeting data or credentials from enumerated services or evading identified defenses throughDisable or Modify ToolsorDisable or Modify Cloud Logs.ID:T1526Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:Praetorian; Suzy Schapperle - Microsoft Azure Red Team; Thanabodi Phrakhun, I-SECUREVersion:1.3Created:30 August 2019Last Modified:04 May 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan enumerate information about a variety of cloud services, such as Office 365 and Sharepoint instances or OpenID Configurations.[5]S1091PacuPacucan enumerate AWS services, such as CloudTrail and CloudWatch.[4]S0684ROADToolsROADToolscan enumerate Azure AD applications and service principals.[6]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities based on the information obtained.Normal, benign system and network events that look like cloud service discovery may be uncommon, depending on the environment and how they are used. Monitor cloud service usage for anomalous behavior that may indicate adversarial presence within the environment.ReferencesMicrosoft. (2019, May 20). Azure Resource Manager.
