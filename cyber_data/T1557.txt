By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.[1]For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.[2][3][4]Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials, including access tokens (Steal Application Access Token) and session cookies (Steal Web Session Cookie).[5][6]Downgrade Attacks can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.[7][8][9]Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as inTransmitted Data Manipulation. Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially toImpair Defensesand/or in support of aNetwork Denial of Service.ID:T1557Sub-techniques:T1557.001,T1557.002,T1557.003ⓘTactics:Credential Access,CollectionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Daniil Yugoslavskiy, @yugoslavskiy, Atomic Threat Coverage project; Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; NECVersion:2.4Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:18 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0281DokDokproxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP(S) traffic.[10][11]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.[12]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramDisable legacy network protocols that may be used   to intercept network traffic if applicable, especially those that are not needed within an environment.M1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traffic that may contain credentials is protected by SSL/TLS.M1037Filter Network TrafficUse network appliances and host-based security software to block network traffic that is not necessary within the environment, such as legacy protocols that may be leveraged for AiTM conditions.M1035Limit Access to Resource Over NetworkLimit access to network infrastructure and resources that can be used to reshape traffic or otherwise produce AiTM conditions.M1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traffic patterns indicative of AiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.M1030Network SegmentationNetwork segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access. This may mitigate, or at least alleviate, the scope of AiTM activity.M1017User TrainingTrain users to be suspicious about certificate errors. Adversaries may use their own certificates in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. Certificate errors may arise when the application’s certificate does not match the one expected by the host.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor application logs for changes to settings and other events associated with network protocols and other services commonly abused for AiTM.[13]DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor network traffic for anomalies associated with known AiTM behavior.Network Traffic FlowMonitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.DS0019ServiceService CreationMonitor for newly constructed services/daemons through Windows event logs for event IDs 4697 and 7045. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as remote logins or process creation events.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key ModificationMonitor HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient for changes to the "EnableMulticast" DWORD value. A value of "0" indicates LLMNR is disabled.ReferencesRapid7. (n.d.). Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks. Retrieved March 2, 2020.Tu, L. Ma, Y. Ye, G. (2020, October 1).
