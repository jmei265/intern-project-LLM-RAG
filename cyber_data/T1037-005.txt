Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.[1]This is technically a deprecated technology (superseded byLaunch Daemon), and thus the appropriate folder,/Library/StartupItemsisn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist),StartupParameters.plist, reside in the top-level directory.An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.[2]Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.ID:T1037.005Sub-technique of:T1037ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:macOSⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:1.0Created:15 January 2020Last Modified:20 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0283jRATjRATcan list and manage startup entries.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsSince StartupItems are deprecated, preventing all users from writing to the/Library/StartupItemsdirectory would prevent any startup items from getting registered.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for logon scriptsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files by unusual accounts outside of normal administration dutiesFile ModificationMonitor for changes made to files for unexpected modifications to /Library/StartupItem folderDS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that execute during the boot up process to check for unusual or unknown applications and behaviorReferencesApple.
