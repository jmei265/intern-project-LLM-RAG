These devices may include the motherboard, hard drive, or video cards.In general, adversaries may manipulate, overwrite, or corrupt firmware in order to deny the use of the system or devices. For example, corruption of firmware responsible for loading the operating system for network devices may render the network devices inoperable.[2][3]Depending on the device, this attack may also result inData Destruction.ID:T1495Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityVersion:1.2Created:12 April 2019Last Modified:31 August 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0606Bad RabbitBad Rabbithas used an executable that installs a modified bootloader to prevent normal boot-up.[4]S0266TrickBotTrickBotmodule "Trickboot" can write or erase the UEFI/BIOS firmware of a compromised device.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1046Boot IntegrityCheck the integrity of the existing BIOS and device firmware to determine if it is vulnerable to modification.M1026Privileged Account ManagementPrevent adversary access to privileged accounts or access necessary to replace system firmware.M1051Update SoftwarePatch the BIOS and other firmware as necessary to prevent successful use of known vulnerabilities.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0001FirmwareFirmware ModificationMonitor for changes made to the firmware for unexpected modifications to settings and/or data.[6]Log attempts to read/write to BIOS and compare against known patching behavior.ReferencesYamamura, M.
