If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, "domainless" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.ID:T1090.004Sub-technique of:T1090ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Matt Kelly, @breakersallVersion:1.1Created:14 March 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has used the meek domain fronting plugin forTorto hide the destination of C2 traffic.[2]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikehas the ability to accept a value for HTTP Host Header to enable domain fronting.[3]S0175meekmeekuses Domain Fronting to disguise the destination of network traffic as another server that is hosted in the same Content Delivery Network (CDN) as the intended destination.S0699MythicMythicsupports domain fronting via custom request headers.[4]S0649SMOKEDHAMSMOKEDHAMhas used a fronted domain to obfuscate its hard-coded C2 server domain.[5]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1020SSL/TLS InspectionIf it is possible to inspect HTTPS traffic, the captures can be analyzed for connections that appear to be domain fronting.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
