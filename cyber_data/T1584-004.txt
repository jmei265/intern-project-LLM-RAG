Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control.[1]Instead of purchasing aServerorVirtual Private Server, adversaries may compromise third-party servers in support of operations.Adversaries may also compromise web servers to support watering hole operations, as inDrive-by Compromise, or email servers to supportPhishingoperations.ID:T1584.004Sub-technique of:T1584ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Dor Edry, MicrosoftVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:31 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0023APT16APT16has compromised otherwise legitimate sites as staging servers for second-stage payloads.[2]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas compromised legitimate websites to host C2 and malware modules.[3]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscahas used compromised web servers as part of their operational infrastructure.[1]G0119Indrik SpiderIndrik Spiderhas served fake updates via legitimate websites that have been compromised.[4]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas compromised servers to stage malicious tools.[5]C0002Night DragonDuringNight Dragon, threat actors compromised web servers to use for C2.[6]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupcompromised servers to host their malicious tools.[7][8][9]C0013Operation SharpshooterForOperation Sharpshooter, the threat actors compromised a server they used as part of the campaign's infrastructure.[10]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamcompromised legitimate Linux servers running the EXIM mail transfer agent for use in subsequent campaigns.[11][12]G0010TurlaTurlahas used compromised servers as infrastructure.[13][14][15]G1017Volt TyphoonVolt Typhoonhas used compromised PRTG servers from other organizations for C2.[16]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries have provisioned software on a compromised server (ex: for use as a command and control server), internet scans may reveal servers that adversaries have compromised. Consider looking for identifiable patterns such as services listening, certificates in use, SSL/TLS negotiation features, or other response artifacts associated with adversary C2 software.[17][18][19]Response MetadataMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control.ReferencesChen, J., et al. (2022).
