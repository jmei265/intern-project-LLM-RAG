To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account. If adversaries lack credentials to victim accounts, they may also abuse automatic push notification generation when this option is configured for self-service password reset (SSPR).[1]In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to "MFA fatigue."[2][3][4]ID:T1621Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Jon Sternstein, Stern Security; Obsidian Security; Pawel Partyka, Microsoft 365 Defender; Shanief WebbVersion:1.1Created:01 April 2022Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has used repeated MFA requests to gain access to victim accounts.[4][5]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spiderattempted to gain access by continuously sending MFA messages to the victim until they accept the MFA push challenge.[6]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has spammed target users with MFA prompts in the hope that the legitimate user will grant necessary approval.[7]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderhas used multifactor authentication (MFA) fatigue by sending repeated MFA authentication requests to targets.[8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1036Account Use PoliciesEnable account restrictions to prevent login attempts, and the subsequent 2FA/MFA service requests, from being initiated from suspicious locations or when the source of the login attempts do not match the location of the 2FA/MFA smart device. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.[9]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationImplement more secure 2FA/MFA mechanisms in replacement of simple push or one-click 2FA/MFA options. For example, having users enter a one-time code provided by the login screen into the 2FA/MFA application or utilizing other out-of-band 2FA/MFA mechanisms (such as rotating code-based hardware tokens providing rotating codes that need an accompanying user pin) may be more secure. Furthermore, change default configurations and implement limits upon the maximum number of 2FA/MFA request prompts that can be sent to users in period of time.[3]M1017User TrainingTrain users to only accept 2FA/MFA requests from login attempts they initiated, to review source location of the login attempt prompting the 2FA/MFA requests, and to report suspicious/unsolicited prompts.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor application logs for suspicious events including repeated MFA failures that may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor 2FA/MFA application logs for suspicious events such as rapid login attempts with valid credentials.Logon Session MetadataMonitor 2FA/MFA application logs for suspicious events such as unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device approving 2FA/MFA request prompts.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor user account logs for suspicious events: unusual login attempt source location, mismatch in location of login attempt and smart device receiving 2FA/MFA request prompts, and high volume of repeated login attempts, all of which may indicate user's primary credentials have been compromised minus 2FA/MFA mechanism.ReferencesNoah Corradin and Shuyang Wang.
