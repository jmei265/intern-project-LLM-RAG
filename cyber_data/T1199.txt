Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such,Valid Accountsused by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.[1]In Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.[2]ID:T1199Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:ExtraHop; Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); PraetorianVersion:2.3Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28OnceAPT28gained access to the DCCC network, the group then proceeded to use that access to compromise the DNC network.[3]G0016APT29APT29has compromised IT, cloud services, and managed services providers to gain broad access to multiple customers for subsequent operations.[4]G0115GOLD SOUTHFIELDGOLD SOUTHFIELDhas breached Managed Service Providers (MSP's) to deliver malware to MSP customers.[5]G1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has accessed internet-facing identity providers such as Azure Active Directory and Okta to target specific organizations.[6]G0045menuPassmenuPasshas used legitimate access granted to Managed Service Providers in order to access victims of interest.[7][8][9][10][11]G1005POLONIUMPOLONIUMhas used compromised credentials from an IT company to target downstream customers including a law firm and aviation company.[12]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas used dedicated network connections from one victim organization to gain unauthorized access to a separate organization.[13]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29gained access through compromised accounts at cloud solution partners, and used compromised certificates issued by Mimecast to authenticate to Mimecast customer systems.[14][15]G0027Threat Group-3390Threat Group-3390has compromised third party service providers to gain access to victim's environments.[16]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationRequire MFA for all delegated administrator accounts.[17]M1030Network SegmentationNetwork segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access.M1018User Account ManagementProperly manage accounts and permissions used by parties in trusted relationships to minimize potential abuse by the party and if the party is compromised by an adversary.

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesCISA.
