Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.ID:T1070Sub-techniques:T1070.001,T1070.002,T1070.003,T1070.004,T1070.005,T1070.006,T1070.007,T1070.008,T1070.009ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Containers, Google Workspace, Linux, Network, Office 365, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Host intrusion prevention systems, Log analysisContributors:Blake Strom, Microsoft 365 Defender; Brad Geesaman, @bradgeesaman; Ed Williams, Trustwave, SpiderLabsVersion:2.1Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:11 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1023APT5APT5has used the THINBLOOD utility to clear SSL VPN log files located at/home/runtime/logs.[1][2]S0239BankshotBankshotdeletes all artifacts associated with the malware from the infected machine.[3]S0089BlackEnergyBlackEnergyhas removed the watermark associated with enabling theTESTSIGNINGboot configuration option by removing the relevant strings in theuser32.dll.muiof the system.[4]S0527CSPY DownloaderCSPY Downloaderhas the ability to remove values it writes to the Registry.[5]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors cleared logs to remove traces of their activity and restored compromised systems to a clean state to bypass manufacturer mitigations for CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887.[6][7]S0673DarkWatchmanDarkWatchmancan uninstall malicious components from the Registry, stop processes, and clear the browser history.[8]S0695DonutDonutcan erase file references to payloads in-memory after being reflectively loaded and executed.[9]S0568EVILNUMEVILNUMhas a function called "DeleteLeftovers" to remove certain artifacts of the attack.[10]S0696FlagproFlagprocan close specific Windows Security and Internet Explorer dialog boxes to mask external connections.[11]S1044FunnyDreamFunnyDreamhas the ability to clean traces of malware deployment.[12]S0697HermeticWiperHermeticWipercan disable pop-up information about folders and desktop items and delete Registry keys to hide malicious services.[13][14]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas restored maliciousKernelCallbackTablecode to its original state after the process execution flow has been hijacked.[15]S0449MazeMazehas used the "Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection" function following attempts to delete the shadow volumes, in order to leave the system in the same state as it was prior to redirection.[16]S0455MetamorfoMetamorfohas a command to delete a Registry key it uses,\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\notes.[17]S0691NeoichorNeoichorcan clear the browser history on a compromised host by changing theClearBrowsingHistoryOnExitvalue to 1 in theHKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\PrivacyRegistry key.[18]S0229OrzOrzcan overwrite Registry settings to reduce its visibility on the victim.[19]S0448Rising SunRising Suncan clear a memory blog in the process by overwriting it with junk bytes.[20]S1085SardonicSardonichas the ability to delete created WMI objects to evade detections.[21]S0461SDBbotSDBbothas the ability to clean up and remove data structures from a compromised host.[22]S0596ShadowPadShadowPadhas deleted arbitrary Registry values.[23]S0589SibotSibotwill delete an associated registry key if a certain server response is received.[24]S0692SILENTTRINITYSILENTTRINITYcan remove artifacts from the compromised host, including created Registry keys.[25]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29temporarily replaced legitimate utilities with their own, executed their payload, and then restored the original file.[26]S0603StuxnetStuxnetcan delete OLE Automation and SQL stored procedures used to store malicious payloads.[27]S0559SUNBURSTSUNBURSTremoved HTTP proxy registry values to clean up traces of execution.[28]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationObfuscate/encrypt event files locally and in transit to avoid giving feedback to an adversary.M1029Remote Data StorageAutomatically forward events to a log server or data repository to prevent conditions in which the adversary can locate and manipulate data on the local system.

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionMonitor for API calls that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.Process CreationMonitor for newly executed processes that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.DS0003Scheduled JobScheduled Job ModificationMonitor for changes made to scheduled jobs that may attempt to remove artifacts on a host system.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for an attempt by a user to gain access to a network or computing resource, often by providing credentials that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.User Account DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletions of user accounts. Windows event logs may highlight activity associated with an adversary's attempt to remove an account (e.g.,Event ID 4726 - A user account was deleted).Alerting on these Event IDs may generate a high degree of false positives, so compare against baseline knowledge for how systems are typically used and correlate account modification events with other indications of malicious activity where possible.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key DeletionMonitor windows registry keys that may be deleted or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.Windows Registry Key ModificationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys or values that may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files such as quarantined malware.ReferencesPerez, D. et al.
