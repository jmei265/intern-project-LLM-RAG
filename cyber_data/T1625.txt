Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time.There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution. A primary way is by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs or resources, such as file directories, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.ID:T1625Sub-techniques:T1625.001Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:AndroidⓘMTC ID:APP-27Version:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0311YiSpecterYiSpecterhas hijacked normal application’s launch routines to display ads.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation could detect unauthorized operating system modifications.M1004System Partition IntegrityAndroid Verified Boot can detect unauthorized modifications made to the system partition, which could lead to execution flow hijacking.[2]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusMobile threat defense agents could detect unauthorized operating system modifications by using attestation.ReferencesClaud Xiao.
