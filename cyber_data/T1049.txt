The actions performed are likely the same types of discovery techniques depending on the operating system, but the resulting information may include details about the networked cloud environment relevant to the adversary's goals. Cloud providers may have different ways in which their virtual networks operate.[1][2][3]Similarly, adversaries who gain access to network devices may also perform similar discovery activities to gather information about connected systems and services.Utilities and commands that acquire this information includenetstat, "net use," and "net session" withNet. In Mac and Linux,netstatandlsofcan be used to list current connections.who -aandwcan be used to show which users are currently logged in, similar to "net session". Additionally, built-in features native to network devices andNetwork Device CLImay be used (e.g.show ip sockets,show tcp brief).[4]ID:T1049Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:DiscoveryⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; PraetorianVersion:2.4Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:06 September 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0018admin@338admin@338actors used the following command following exploitation of a machine withLOWBALLmalware to display network connections:netstat -ano >> %temp%\download[5]G0138AndarielAndarielhas used thenetstat -naop tcpcommand to display TCP connections on a victim's machine.[6]G0006APT1APT1used thenet usecommand to get a listing on network connections.[7]G0022APT3APT3has a tool that can enumerate current network connections.[8][9][10]G0050APT32APT32used thenetstat -anpo tcpcommand to display TCP connections on the victim's machine.[11]G0082APT38APT38installed a port monitoring tool, MAPMAKER, to print the active TCP connections on the local system.[12]G0096APT41APT41has enumerated IP addresses of network resources and used thenetstatcommand as part of network reconnaissance.
