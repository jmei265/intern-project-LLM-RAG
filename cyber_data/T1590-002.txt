DNS information may include a variety of details, including registered name servers as well as records that outline addressing for a target’s subdomains, mail servers, and other hosts. DNS, MX, TXT, and SPF records may also reveal the use of third party cloud and SaaS providers, such as Office 365, G Suite, Salesforce, or Zendesk.[1]Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as querying or otherwise collecting details viaDNS/Passive DNS. DNS information may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:Search Open Technical Databases).[2][3]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Search Open Technical Databases,Search Open Websites/Domains, orActive Scanning), establishing operational resources (ex:Acquire InfrastructureorCompromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex:External Remote Services).ID:T1590.002Sub-technique of:T1590ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)Version:1.1Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls. Efforts should focus on minimizing the amount and sensitivity of data available to external parties.DetectionMuch of this activity may have a very high occurrence and associated false positive rate, as well as potentially taking place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection difficult for defenders.Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access.ReferencesSean Metcalf.
