Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.For example, with a sufficient level of access, the Windowsnet user /addcommand can be used to create a local account. On macOS systems thedscl -createcommand can be used to create a local account. Local accounts may also be added to network devices, often via commonNetwork Device CLIcommands such asusername, or to Kubernetes clusters using thekubectlutility.[1][2]Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.ID:T1136.001Sub-technique of:T1136ⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Containers, Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defenseVersion:1.3Created:28 January 2020Last Modified:16 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3APT3has been known to create or enable accounts, such assupport_388945a0.[3]G0087APT39APT39has created accounts on multiple compromised hosts to perform actions within the network.[4]G0096APT41APT41has created user accounts.[5]G1023APT5APT5has created Local Administrator accounts to maintain access to systems with short-cycle credential rotation.[6]S0274CalistoCalistohas the capability to add its own account to the victim's machine.[7]S0030CarbanakCarbanakcan create a Windows account.[8]S1111DarkGateDarkGatecreates a local user account,SafeMode, vianet usercommands.[9]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas created accounts on victims, including administrator accounts, some of which appeared to be tailored to each individual staging target.[10]S0363EmpireEmpirehas a module for creating a local user if permissions allow.[11]G1016FIN13FIN13has created MS-SQL local accounts in a compromised network.[12]S0143FlameFlamecan create backdoor accounts with login "HelpAssistant" on domain connected systems if appropriate rights are available.[13][14]G0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas created a local user account with administrator privileges.[15]S0493GoldenSpyGoldenSpycan create new users on an infected system.[16]S0394HiddenWaspHiddenWaspcreates a user account as a means to provide initial persistence to the compromised machine.[17]S0601HildegardHildegardhas created a user named "monerodaemon".[18]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas created accounts withnet user.[19]G0077LeafminerLeafminerused a tool called Imecab to set up a persistent remote access account on the victim machine.[20]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas created local accounts namedhelpandDefaultAccounton compromised machines.[21][22]S0084Mis-TypeMis-Typemay create a temporary user on the system namedLost_{Unique Identifier}.[23]S0039NetThenet user username \passwordcommands inNetcan be used to create a local account.[24]S0192PupyPupycan user PowerView to execute "net user" commands and create local system accounts.[25]S0085S-TypeS-Typemay create a temporary user on the system namedLost_{Unique Identifier}with the passwordpond~!@6"{Unique Identifier}.[23]S0382ServHelperServHelperhas created a new user named "supportaccount".[26]S0649SMOKEDHAMSMOKEDHAMhas created user accounts.[27]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas created local privileged users on victim machines.[28]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas created local administrator accounts to maintain persistence in compromised networks.[29]S0412ZxShellZxShellhas a feature to create local user accounts.[30]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit the number of accounts permitted to create other accounts.
