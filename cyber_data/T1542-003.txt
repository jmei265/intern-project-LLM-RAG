Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, including the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR).[1]The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS. It is the location of the boot loader. An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code.[2]The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR. Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code.ID:T1542.003Sub-technique of:T1542ⓘTactics:Persistence,Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEMⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, File monitoring, Host intrusion prevention systemsVersion:1.1Created:19 December 2019Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has deployed a bootkit along withDowndelphto ensure its persistence on the victim.
