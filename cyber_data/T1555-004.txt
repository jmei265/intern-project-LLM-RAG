The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).[1][2]The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers. As part ofCredentials from Web Browsers, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker. Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted.vcrdfiles, located under%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\. The encryption key can be found in a file namedPolicy.vpol, typically located in the same folder as the credentials.[3][4]Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms.vaultcmd.exeis a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Windows APIs, such asCredEnumerateA, may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.[5][6]Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups. Credential backups and restorations may be performed by runningrundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgrthen selecting the "Back up..." button on the "Stored User Names and Passwords" GUI.Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.[4]ID:T1555.004Sub-technique of:T1555ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:WindowsContributors:Bernaldo Penas Antelo; Mugdha Peter Bansode; Uriel Kosayev; Vadim KhrykovVersion:1.1Created:23 November 2020Last Modified:21 October 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0526KGH_SPYKGH_SPYcan collect credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.[7]S0349LaZagneLaZagnecan obtain credentials from Vault files.[8]S0681LizarLizarhas a plugin that can retrieve credentials from Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge usingvaultcmd.exeand another that can collect RDP access credentials using theCredEnumerateWfunction.[9]S0002MimikatzMimikatzcontains functionality to acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.[6]G0049OilRigOilRighas used credential dumping tool named VALUEVAULT to steal credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.[10]S0194PowerSploitPowerSploitcontains a collection of Exfiltration modules that can harvest credentials from Windows vault credential objects.[11][12]S0629RainyDayRainyDaycan use the QuarksPwDump tool to obtain local passwords and domain cached credentials.[13]S0240ROKRATROKRATcan steal credentials by leveraging the Windows Vault mechanism.[14]S0692SILENTTRINITYSILENTTRINITYcan gather Windows Vault credentials.[15]G0038Stealth FalconStealth Falconmalware gathers passwords from the Windows Credential Vault.[16]G0010TurlaTurlahas gathered credentials from the Windows Credential Manager tool.[17]S0476ValakValakcan use a .NET compiled module named exchgrabber to enumerate credentials from the Credential Manager.[18]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas used PowerShell cmdletInvoke-WCMDumpto enumerate Windows credentials in the Credential Manager in a compromised network.[19]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider enabling the "Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication" setting that will prevent network credentials from being stored by the Credential Manager.[20]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for suspicious activity listing credentials from the Windows Credentials locker (e.g.vaultcmd /listcreds:"Windows Credentials").[4]DS0022FileFile AccessConsider monitoring file reads to Vault locations,%Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\, for suspicious activity.[4]DS0009ProcessOS API ExecutionConsider monitoring API calls such asCredEnumerateAthat may list credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.[5][6]Process CreationMonitor newly executed processes for suspicious activity listing credentials from the Windows Credentials locker (e.g.vaultcmd /listcreds:"Windows Credentials").[4]ReferencesMicrosoft.
