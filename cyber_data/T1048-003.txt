The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.[1]Adversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields.ID:T1048.003Sub-technique of:T1048ⓘTactic:ExfiltrationⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Austin Clark, @c2defense; William CainVersion:2.1Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:12 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0331Agent TeslaAgent Teslahas routines for exfiltration over SMTP, FTP, and HTTP.[2][3][4]G0050APT32APT32's backdoor can exfiltrate data by encoding it in the subdomain field of DNS packets.[5]G0064APT33APT33has used FTP to exfiltrate files (separately from the C2 channel).[6]S0190BITSAdminBITSAdmincan be used to createBITS Jobsto upload files from a compromised host.[7]S0252Brave PrinceSomeBrave Princevariants have used South  Korea's Daum email service to exfiltrate information, and later variants have posted the data to a web server via an HTTP post command.[8]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41exfiltrated victim data via DNS lookups by encoding and prepending it as subdomains to the attacker-controlled domain.[9]S0335CarbonCarbonuses HTTP to send data to the C2 server.[10]S1043ccf32ccf32can upload collected data and files to an FTP server.[11]S0674CharmPowerCharmPowercan send victim data via FTP with credentials hardcoded in the script.[12]S0107Cherry PickerCherry Pickerexfiltrates files over FTP.[13]S0492CookieMinerCookieMinerhas used thecurl --upload-filecommand to exfiltrate data over HTTP.[14]S0212CORALDECKCORALDECKhas exfiltrated data in HTTP POST headers.[15]S0050CosmicDukeCosmicDukeexfiltrates collected files over FTP or WebDAV.

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesCisco.
