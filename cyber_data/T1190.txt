The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.Exploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet accessible open sockets.[1][2][3][4][5]Depending on the flaw being exploited this may also involveExploitation for Defense EvasionorExploitation for Client Execution.If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access viaEscape to Host, or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.Adversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, specifically targeting devices that do not support robust host-based defenses.[6][7]For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.[8][9]ID:T1190Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Initial AccessⓘPlatforms:Containers, IaaS, Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Praetorian; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:2.5Created:18 April 2018Last Modified:28 November 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28has used a variety of public exploits, including CVE 2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144, to gain execution on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange; they have also conducted SQL injection attacks against external websites.[10][11]G0016APT29APT29has exploited CVE-2019-19781 for Citrix, CVE-2019-11510 for Pulse Secure VPNs, CVE-2018-13379 for FortiGate VPNs, and CVE-2019-9670 in Zimbra software to gain access.[12][13]G0087APT39APT39has used SQL injection for initial compromise.[14]G0096APT41APT41exploited CVE-2020-10189 against Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central through unsafe deserialization, and CVE-2019-19781 to compromise Citrix Application Delivery Controllers (ADC) and gateway devices.[15]APT41leveraged vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon exploitation or SQL injection for initial access.[16]G1023APT5APT5has exploited vulnerabilities in externally facing software and devices including Pulse Secure VPNs and Citrix Application Delivery Controllers.[17][18][19][20]G0001AxiomAxiomhas been observed using SQL injection to gain access to systems.[21][22]G0135BackdoorDiplomacyBackdoorDiplomacyhas exploited CVE-2020-5902, an F5 BIP-IP vulnerability, to drop a Linux backdoor.BackdoorDiplomacyhas also exploited mis-configured Plesk servers.[23]G0098BlackTechBlackTechhas exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0, CVE-2017-7269, in order to establish a new HTTP or command and control (C2) server.[24]G0108Blue MockingbirdBlue Mockingbirdhas gained initial access by exploiting CVE-2019-18935, a vulnerability within Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX.[25]C0017C0017DuringC0017,APT41exploited CVE-2021-44207 in the USAHerds application and CVE-2021-44228 in Log4j, as well as other .NET deserialization, SQL injection, and directory traversal vulnerabilities to gain initial access.[26]C0018C0018DuringC0018, the threat actors exploited VMWare Horizon Unified Access Gateways that were vulnerable to several Log4Shell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, and CVE-2021-44832.[27]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spiderexploited CVE-2021-35464 in the ForgeRock Open Access Management (OpenAM) application server to gain initial access.[28]G1021Cinnamon TempestCinnamon Tempesthas exploited multiple unpatched vulnerabilities for initial access including vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange, Manage Engine AdSelfService Plus, Confluence, and Log4j.[29][30][31][32]S1105COATHANGERCOATHANGERis installed following exploitation of a vulnerable FortiGate device.[33]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors exploited CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances to enable authentication bypass and command injection.

externally facing servers and services from the rest of the network with a DMZ or on separate hosting infrastructure.M1026Privileged Account ManagementUse least privilege for service accounts will limit what permissions the exploited process gets on the rest of the system.M1051Update SoftwareUpdate software regularly by employing patch management for externally exposed applications.M1016Vulnerability ScanningRegularly scan externally facing systems for vulnerabilities and establish procedures to rapidly patch systems when critical vulnerabilities are discovered through scanning and through public disclosure.[8]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentDetecting software exploitation may be difficult depending on the tools available. Software exploits may not always succeed or may cause the exploited process to become unstable or crash. Web Application Firewalls may detect improper inputs attempting exploitation.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentUse deep packet inspection to look for artifacts of common exploit traffic, such as SQL injection strings or known payloads. For example, monitor for successively chained functions that adversaries commonly abuse (i.e. gadget chaining) through unsafe deserialization to exploit publicly facing applications for initial access.[83]ReferencesNational Vulnerability Database.
