Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:Policies, procedures, and standardsPhysical / logical network diagramsSystem architecture diagramsTechnical system documentationTesting / development credentialsWork / project schedulesSource code snippetsLinks to network shares and other internal resourcesID:T1213.001Sub-technique of:T1213ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:SaaSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:14 February 2020Last Modified:08 June 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1004LAPSUS$LAPSUS$has searched a victim's network for collaboration platforms like Confluence and JIRA to discover further high-privilege account credentials.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditConsider periodic review of accounts and privileges for critical and sensitive Confluence repositories.M1018User Account ManagementEnforce the principle of least-privilege.

Watch for access to Confluence repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for newly constructed logon behavior across Atlassian's Confluence which can be configured to report access to certain pages and documents through AccessLogFilter.[2]Additional log storage and analysis infrastructure will likely be required for more robust detection capabilities.ReferencesMSTIC, DART, M365 Defender.
