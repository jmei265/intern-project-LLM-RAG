This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such asNetwork SniffingorTransmitted Data Manipulation.The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.[1]Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.[2][3]Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.[2]ID:T1557.002Sub-technique of:T1557ⓘTactics:Credential Access,CollectionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Jon Sternstein, Stern SecurityVersion:1.1Created:15 October 2020Last Modified:22 July 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0003CleaverCleaverhas used custom tools to facilitate ARP cache poisoning.[3]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas used ARP spoofing to redirect a compromised machine to an actor-controlled website.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramConsider disabling updating the ARP cache on gratuitous ARP replies.M1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationEnsure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately. Use best practices for authentication protocols, such as Kerberos, and ensure web traffic that may contain credentials is protected by SSL/TLS.M1037Filter Network TrafficConsider enabling DHCP Snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection on switches to create mappings between IP addresses requested via DHCP and ARP tables and tie the values to a port on the switch that may block bogus traffic.[5][6]M1035Limit Access to Resource Over NetworkCreate static ARP entries for networked devices. Implementing static ARP entries may be infeasible for large networks.M1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that can identify traffic patterns indicative of AiTM activity can be used to mitigate activity at the network level.M1017User TrainingTrain users to be suspicious about certificate errors. Adversaries may use their own certificates in an attempt to intercept HTTPS traffic. Certificate errors may arise when the application’s certificate does not match the one expected by the host.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor network traffic for unusual ARP traffic, gratuitous ARP replies may be suspicious. Consider collecting changes to ARP caches across endpoints for signs of ARP poisoning. For example, if multiple IP addresses map to a single MAC address, this could be an indicator that the ARP cache has been poisoned.Network Traffic FlowMonitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices. Local network traffic metadata (such as source MAC addressing) as well as usage of network management protocols such as DHCP may be helpful in identifying hardware.ReferencesPlummer, D.
