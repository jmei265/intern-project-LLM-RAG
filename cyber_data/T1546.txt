Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.[1][2][3]Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.[4][5][6]Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.ID:T1546Sub-techniques:T1546.001,T1546.002,T1546.003,T1546.004,T1546.005,T1546.006,T1546.007,T1546.008,T1546.009,T1546.010,T1546.011,T1546.012,T1546.013,T1546.014,T1546.015,T1546.016ⓘTactics:Privilege Escalation,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSVersion:1.3Created:22 January 2020Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1091PacuPacucan set up S3 bucket notifications to trigger a malicious Lambda function when a CloudFormation template is uploaded to the bucket.

Look for abnormal process behavior that may be due to a process loading a malicious DLL. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as making network connections for Command and Control, learning details about the environment through Discovery, and conducting Lateral Movement.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationTools such as Sysinternals Autoruns can be used to detect changes to execution triggers that could be attempts at persistence. Also look for abnormal process call trees for execution of other commands that could relate to Discovery actions or other techniques.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key ModificationMonitor for changes made to windows registry keys and/or values that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.DS0005WMIWMI CreationMonitor for newly constructed WMI Objects that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.ReferencesDaniel Grzelak.
