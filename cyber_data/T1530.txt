Similarly, SaaS enterprise platforms such as Office 365 and Google Workspace provide cloud-based document storage to users through services such as OneDrive and Google Drive, while SaaS application providers such as Slack, Confluence, Salesforce, and Dropbox may provide cloud storage solutions as a peripheral or primary use case of their platform.In some cases, as with IaaS-based cloud storage, there exists no overarching application (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) with which to interact with the stored objects: instead, data from these solutions is retrieved directly though theCloud API. In SaaS applications, adversaries may be able to collect this data directly from APIs or backend cloud storage objects, rather than through their front-end application or interface (i.e.,Data from Information Repositories).Adversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions. Providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems, though misconfigurations are a common problem.[1][2][3]There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated users, overly-broad access by all users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.This open access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards, personally identifiable information, or medical records.[4][5][6][7]Adversaries may also obtain then abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects.ID:T1530Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSContributors:AppOmni; Netskope; PraetorianVersion:2.1Created:30 August 2019Last Modified:29 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternals can collect files from a user’s OneDrive.[8]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spideraccessed victim OneDrive environments to search for VPN and MFA enrollment information, help desk instructions, and new hire guides.[9]G0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas obtained files from the victim's cloud storage instances.[10]S1091PacuPacucan enumerate and download files stored in AWS storage services, such as S3 buckets.[11]S0683PeiratesPeiratescan dump the contents of AWS S3 buckets.

At a minimum, ensure an incident response plan to storage breach includes rotating the keys and test for impact on client applications.[14]M1037Filter Network TrafficCloud service providers support IP-based restrictions when accessing cloud resources. Consider using IP allowlisting along with user account management to ensure that data access is restricted not only to valid users but only from expected IP ranges to mitigate the use of stolen credentials to access data.M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationConsider using multi-factor authentication to restrict access to resources and cloud storage APIs.[1]M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsUse access control lists on storage systems and objects.M1018User Account ManagementConfigure user permissions groups and roles for access to cloud storage.[2]Implement strict Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls to prevent access to storage solutions except for the applications, users, and services that require access.[1]Ensure that temporary access tokens are issued rather than permanent credentials, especially when access is being granted to entities outside of the internal security boundary.[15]DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0010Cloud StorageCloud Storage AccessMonitor for unusual queries to the cloud provider's storage service. Activity originating from unexpected sources may indicate improper permissions are set and are allowing access to data. Additionally, detecting failed attempts by a user for a certain object, followed by escalation of privileges by the same user, and access to the same object may be an indication of suspicious activity.ReferencesAmazon.
