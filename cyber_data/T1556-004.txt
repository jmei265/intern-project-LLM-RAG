The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch.  Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code will first check to see if the user input is the password. If so, access is granted. Otherwise, the implanted code will pass the credentials on for verification of potentially valid credentials.[1]ID:T1556.004Sub-technique of:T1556ⓘTactics:Credential Access,Defense Evasion,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorVersion:2.0Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:14 December 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1104SLOWPULSESLOWPULSEcan modify LDAP and two factor authentication flows by inspecting login credentials and forcing successful authentication if the provided password matches a chosen backdoor password.[2]S0519SYNful KnockSYNful Knockhas the capability to add its own custom backdoor password when it modifies the operating system of the affected network device.[1]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS.  Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[3]M1026Privileged Account ManagementRestrict administrator accounts to as few individuals as possible, following least privilege principles.  Prevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts, particularly between network and non-network platforms, such as servers or endpoints.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor for changes made to the checksum of the operating system file and verifying the image of the operating system in memory.[4][5]Detection of this behavior may be difficult, detection efforts may be focused on closely related adversary behaviors, such as Modify System Image.ReferencesBill Hau, Tony Lee, Josh Homan.
