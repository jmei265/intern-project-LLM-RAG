Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.[1]Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar toSystem Binary Proxy Execution, adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.[2]ID:T1053Sub-techniques:T1053.002,T1053.003,T1053.005,T1053.006,T1053.007ⓘTactics:Execution,Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Containers, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, SYSTEM, UserⓘEffective Permissions:Administrator, SYSTEM, UserⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:Alain Homewood, Insomnia Security; Andrew Northern, @ex_raritas; Bryan Campbell, @bry_campbell; Leo Loobeek, @leoloobeek; Prashant Verma, Paladion; Selena Larson, @selenalarson; Travis Smith, Tripwire; Zachary Abzug, @ZackDoesMLVersion:2.3Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:01 March 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1052DEADEYEDEADEYEhas used the scheduled tasks\Microsoft\Windows\PLA\Server Manager Performance Monitor,\Microsoft\Windows\Ras\ManagerMobility,\Microsoft\Windows\WDI\SrvSetupResults, and\Microsoft\Windows\WDI\USOSharedto establish persistence.[3]G1006Earth LuscaEarth Luscaused the commandschtasks /Create /SC ONLOgon /TN WindowsUpdateCheck /TR "[file path]" /ru systemfor persistence.[4]S0447LokibotLokibot's second stage DLL has set a timer using "timeSetEvent" to schedule its next execution.[5]S0125RemsecRemsecschedules the execution one of its modules by creating a new scheduler task.[6]S1034StrifeWaterStrifeWaterhas create a scheduled task namedMozilla\Firefox Default Browser Agent 409046Z0FF4A39CBfor persistence.[7]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditToolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for permission weaknesses in scheduled tasks that could be used to escalate privileges.[8]M1028Operating System ConfigurationConfigure settings for scheduled tasks to force tasks to run under the context of the authenticated account instead of allowing them to run as SYSTEM. The associated Registry key is located atHKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\SubmitControl. The setting can be configured through GPO: Computer Configuration > [Policies] > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options: Domain Controller: Allow server operators to schedule tasks, set to disabled.[9]M1026Privileged Account ManagementConfigure the Increase Scheduling Priority option to only allow the Administrators group the rights to schedule a priority process.
