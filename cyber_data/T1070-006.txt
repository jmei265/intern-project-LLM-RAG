Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder. This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.Timestomping may be used along with file nameMasqueradingto hide malware and tools.[1]ID:T1070.006Sub-technique of:T1070ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:SYSTEM, User, rootⓘDefense Bypassed:Host forensic analysisContributors:Romain Dumont, ESETVersion:1.0Created:31 January 2020Last Modified:29 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS00663PARA RAT3PARA RAThas a command to set certain attributes such as creation/modification timestamps on files.[2]G0007APT28APT28has performed timestomping on victim files.[3]G0016APT29APT29has used timestomping to alter the Standard Information timestamps on their web shells to match other files in the same directory.[4]G0050APT32APT32has used scheduled task raw XML with a backdated timestamp of June 2, 2016.
