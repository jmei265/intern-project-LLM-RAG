Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between significant characters.ID:T1001.001Sub-technique of:T1001ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:15 March 2020Last Modified:02 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28added "junk data" to each encoded string, preventing trivial decoding without knowledge of the junk removal algorithm. Each implant was given a "junk length" value when created, tracked by the controller software to allow seamless communication but prevent analysis of the command protocol on the wire.[2]S0574BendyBearBendyBearhas used byte randomization to obscure its behavior.[3]S0134DowndelphDowndelphinserts pseudo-random characters between each original character during encoding of C2 network requests, making it difficult to write signatures on them.[4]S0588GoldMaxGoldMaxhas used decoy traffic to surround its malicious network traffic to avoid detection.[5]S0632GrimAgentGrimAgentcan pad C2 messages with random generated values.[6]S1020KevinKevincan generate a sequence of dummy HTTP C2 requests to obscure traffic.[7]S1047MoriMorihas obfuscated the FML.dll with 200MB of junk data.[8]S0016P2P ZeuSP2P ZeuSadded junk data to outgoing UDP packets to peer implants.[9]S0626P8RATP8RATcan send randomly-generated data as part of its C2 communication.[10]S0435PLEADPLEADsamples were found to be highly obfuscated with junk code.[11][12]S0559SUNBURSTSUNBURSTadded junk bytes to its C2 over HTTP.[1]S0682TrailBlazerTrailBlazerhas used random identifier strings to obscure its C2 operations and result codes.[13]S0647TurianTuriancan insert pseudo-random characters into its network encryption setup.[14]S0022UroburosUroburoscan add extra characters in encoded strings to help mimic DNS legitimate requests.[15]S0514WellMessWellMesscan use junk data in the Base64 string for additional obfuscation.[16]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate some obfuscation activity at the network level.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesFireEye.
