The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.ID:T1565.001Sub-technique of:T1565ⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:IntegrityVersion:1.1Created:02 March 2020Last Modified:19 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0082APT38APT38has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions.[1]S0562SUNSPOTSUNSPOTcreated a copy of the SolarWinds Orion software source file with a.bkextension to backup the original content, wroteSUNBURSTusing the same filename but with a.tmpextension, and then movedSUNBURSTusingMoveFileExto the original filename with a.csextension so it could be compiled within Orion software.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1041Encrypt Sensitive InformationConsider encrypting important information to reduce an adversary’s ability to perform tailored data modifications.M1029Remote Data StorageConsider implementing IT disaster recovery plans that contain procedures for taking regular data backups that can be used to restore organizational data.[4]Ensure backups are stored off system and is protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and manipulate backups.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsEnsure least privilege principles are applied to important information resources to reduce exposure to data manipulation risk.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0022FileFile CreationMonitor for newly constructed files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile DeletionMonitor for unexpected deletion of a file in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityFile ModificationMonitor for unexpected files with manipulated data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activityReferencesFireEye.
