Commands to remote mobile devices, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile client and server.Web protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS are used for web traffic as well as well as notification services native to mobile messaging services such as Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and newly, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), (GCM/FCM: two-way communication) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS; one-way server-to-device).  Such notification services leverage HTTP/S via the respective API and are commonly abused on Android and iOS respectively in order blend in with routine device traffic making it difficult for enterprises to inspect.ID:T1437.001Sub-technique of:T1437Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-29Version:1.0Created:01 April 2022Last Modified:06 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmucan use HTTP to communicate with the C2 server.[1]S1095AhRatAhRatcan communicate with the C2 using HTTPS requests.[2]S0525Android/AdDisplay.AshasAndroid/AdDisplay.Ashashas communicated with the C2 server using HTTP.[3]S0304Android/Chuli.AAndroid/Chuli.Aused HTTP uploads to a URL as a command and control mechanism.[4]S0540AsacubAsacubhas communicated with the C2 using HTTP POST requests.[5]S1079BOULDSPYBOULDSPYuses unencrypted HTTP traffic between the victim and C2 infrastructure.[6]S1094BRATABRATAcan use both HTTP and WebSockets to communicate with the C2 server.[7]S0432BreadBreadcommunicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests.[8]C0033C0033DuringC0033,PROMETHIUMusedStrongPityto communicate with the C2 server using HTTPS.[9]S0480CerberusCerberuscommunicates with the C2 server using HTTP.[10]S1083ChameleonChameleoncan use HTTP to communicate with the C2 server.[11]S0555CHEMISTGAMESCHEMISTGAMEShas used HTTPS for C2 communication.[12]S0426Concipit1248Concipit1248communicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests.[13]S0425Corona UpdatesCorona Updatescommunicates with the C2 server using HTTP requests.[13]G0070Dark CaracalDark Caracalcontrols implants using standard HTTP communication.[14]S0479DEFENSOR IDDEFENSOR IDhas used Firebase Cloud Messaging for C2.[15]S0478EventBotEventBotcommunicates with the C2 using HTTP requests.[16]S0522ExobotExobothas used HTTPS for C2 communication.[17]S0405ExodusExodusOne checks in with the command and control server using HTTP POST requests.[18]S0509FakeSpyFakeSpyexfiltrates data using HTTP requests.[19]S1067FluBotFluBotcan use HTTP POST requests on port 80 for communicating with its C2 server.[20]S1093FlyTrapFlyTrapcan use HTTP to communicate with the C2 server.[21]S0535Golden CupGolden Cuphas communicated with the C2 using MQTT and HTTP.[22]S0551GoldenEagleGoldenEaglehas used HTTP POST requests for C2.[23]S0536GPlayedGPlayedhas communicated with the C2 using HTTP requests or WebSockets as a backup.[24]S0406GustuffGustuffcommunicates with the command and control server using HTTP requests.[25]S1077HornbillHornbillcan use HTTP and HTTP POST to communicate information to the C2.[26]S0463INSOMNIAINSOMNIAcommunicates with the C2 server using HTTPS requests.[27]S0539Red Alert 2.0Red Alert 2.0has communicated with the C2 using HTTP.[28]S0326RedDropRedDropuses HTTP requests for C2 communication.[29]S0403RiltokRiltokcommunicates with the command and control server using HTTP requests.[30]S0411RotexyRotexycan communicate with the command and control server using JSON payloads sent in HTTP POST request bodies.

                                    it is based on the abuse of system features.DetectionAbuse of standard application protocols can be difficult to detect as many legitimate mobile applications leverage such protocols for language-specific APIs. Enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.ReferencesP Shunk, K Balaam. (2021, October 28).
