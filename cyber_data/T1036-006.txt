With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file calledevil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed toevil.txt, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application (not executing the binary). However, if the file is renamed toevil.txt(note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed[1].Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.ID:T1036.006Sub-technique of:T1036ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserContributors:Erye Hernandez, Palo Alto NetworksVersion:1.0Created:10 February 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0276KeydnapKeydnapputs a space after a false .jpg extension so that execution actually goes through the Terminal.app program.[2]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

From the user's perspective though, this is very hard to notice from within the Finder.app or on the command-line in Terminal.app. Processes executed from binaries containing non-standard extensions in the filename are suspicious.ReferencesDan Goodin.
