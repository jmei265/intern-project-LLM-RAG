WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems.[1]WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.The WMI service enables both local and remote access, though the latter is facilitated byRemote Servicessuch asDistributed Component Object ModelandWindows Remote Management.[1]Remote WMI over DCOM operates using port 135, whereas WMI over WinRM operates over port 5985 when using HTTP and 5986 for HTTPS.[1][2]An adversary can use WMI to interact with local and remote systems and use it as a means to execute various behaviors, such as gathering information forDiscoveryas well asExecutionof commands and payloads.[2]For example,wmic.execan be abused by an adversary to delete shadow copies with the commandwmic.exe Shadowcopy Delete(i.e.,Inhibit System Recovery).[3]Note:wmic.exeis deprecated as of January of 2024, with the WMIC feature being "disabled by default" on Windows 11+. WMIC will be removed from subsequent Windows releases and replaced byPowerShellas the primary WMI interface.[4]In addition to PowerShell and tools likewbemtool.exe, COM APIs can also be used to programmatically interact with WMI via C++, .NET, VBScript, etc.[4]ID:T1047Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ExecutionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘSupports Remote:YesContributors:@ionstorm; Olaf Hartong,

enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block processes created by WMI commands from running. Note: many legitimate tools and applications utilize WMI for command execution.[157]M1038Execution PreventionUse application control configured to block execution ofwmic.exeif it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.

Restrict other users who are allowed to connect, or disallow all users to connect remotely to WMI.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments for actions that are used to perform remote behaviorDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Connection CreationMonitor network traffic for WMI connections for potential use to remotely edit configuration, start services, or query files. When remote WMI requests are over RPC it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC groupnetsvcs. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected. Although the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts. More about RPCSS at : rpcss_dcom_interfaces.htmlLook for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.After the WMI connection has been initialized, a process can be remotely launched using the command:wmic /node:"" process call create "", which is detected in the third Detection Pseudocode.This leaves artifacts at both a network (RPC) and process (command line) level. Whenwmic.exe(or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.After RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be identified.When the command line is executed, it has the parent process ofC:\windows\system32\wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe. This analytic looks for these two events happening in sequence, so that the network connection and target process are output.Certain strings can be identifiers of the WMI by looking up the interface UUID forIRemUnknown2in different formats- UUID00000143-0000-0000-c000-000000000046(decoded)- Hex43 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 c0 00 00 00 00 00 00 46(raw)- ASCIICF(printable text only)This identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase. Any sensor that has access to the byte code as raw, decoded, or ASCII could implement this analytic. The transfer syntax is- UUID8a885d04-1ceb-11c9-9fe8-08002b104860(decoded)- Hex04 5d 88 8a eb 1c c9 11 9f e8 08 00 2b 10 48 60(raw)- ASCII`]+H``(printable text only)Thus, a great ASCII based signature is-CF]+HCFCFhost"Note: To detect WMI over RPC (using DCOM), a sensor needs to exist that has the insight into individual connections and can actually decode and make sense of RPC traffic. Specifically, WMI can be detected by looking at RPC traffic where the target interface matches that of WMI, which is IRemUnknown2. Look for instances of the WMI querying in network traffic, and find the cases where a process is launched immediately after a connection is seen. This essentially merges the request to start a remote process via WMI with the process execution. If other processes are spawned from wmiprvse.exe in this time frame, it is possible for race conditions to occur, and the wrong process may be merged. If this is the case, it may be useful to look deeper into the network traffic to see if the desired command can be extracted.Analytic 1 - Remote WMI over RPCsource="*Zeek:RPC" dest_port="135" protocol_rpc_interface="IRemUnknown2"DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines of "wmic". If the command line utilitywmic.exeis used on the source host, then it can additionally be detected on an analytic. The command line on the source host is constructed into something likewmic.exe /node:"\<hostname>" process call create "\<command line>". It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string"\<hostname>"would instead look like IP Address. Processes can be created remotely via WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility PowerShell.Note: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created).Besides executing arbitrary processes, wmic.exe can also be used to executed data stored in NTFS alternate data streamsNTFS File Attributes.Looks for instances of wmic.exe as well as the substrings in the command line:- process call create- /node:Analytic 1 : Create Remote Process via WMIC(source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" EventCode="1") OR (source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode="4688") AND Image="wmic.exe" AND CommandLine="process call create *"DS0005WMIWMI CreationMonitor for newly constructed WMI objects that will execute malicious commands and payloads.ReferencesMicrosoft.
