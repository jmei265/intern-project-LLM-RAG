Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis, or enable operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).ID:T1481.001Sub-technique of:T1481Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.2Created:06 April 2022Last Modified:14 August 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0310ANDROIDOS_ANSERVER.AANDROIDOS_ANSERVER.Auses encrypted content within a blog site for part of its command and control.
