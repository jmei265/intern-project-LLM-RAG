Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. An example packer is FTT. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.ID:T1406.002Sub-technique of:T1406Tactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSVersion:1.1Created:30 March 2022Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1094BRATABRATAhas utilized commercial software packers.[1]S0432BreadBreadpayloads have used several commercially available packers.[2]S0406GustuffGustuffcode is both obfuscated and packed with an FTT packer.[3]S1062S.O.V.A.S.O.V.A.has been distributed in obfuscated and packed form.[4]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Packing is not a definitive indicator of malicious activity, because as legitimate software may use packing techniques to reduce binary size or to protect proprietary code.ReferencesFernando Ruiz.
