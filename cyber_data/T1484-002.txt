For example, in Microsoft Active Directory (AD) environments, this may be used to forgeSAML Tokenswithout the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials. Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing certificate. An adversary may also convert an AD domain to a federated domain using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), which may enable malicious trust modifications such as altering the claim issuance rules to log in any valid set of credentials as a specified user.[2]An adversary may also add a new federated identity provider to an identity tenant such as Okta, which may enable the adversary to authenticate as any user of the tenant.[3]ID:T1484.002Sub-technique of:T1484ⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, SaaS, WindowsⓘPermissions Required:AdministratorContributors:Blake Strom, Microsoft 365 Defender; Obsidian Security; PraetorianVersion:2.0Created:28 December 2020Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0677AADInternalsAADInternalscan create a backdoor by converting a domain to a federated domain which will be able to authenticate any user across the tenant.AADInternalscan also modify DesktopSSO information.[4][5]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spideradds a federated identity provider to the victim’s SSO tenant and activates automatic account linking.[6]C0024SolarWinds CompromiseDuring theSolarWinds Compromise,APT29changed domain federation trust settings using Azure AD administrative permissions to configure the domain to accept authorization tokens signed by their own SAML signing certificate.[7][8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1026Privileged Account ManagementUse the principal of least privilege and protect administrative access to domain trusts and identity tenants.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0026Active DirectoryActive Directory Object CreationMonitor for newly constructed active directory objects, such as Windows EID 5137.Active Directory Object ModificationMonitor for changes made to AD settings for unexpected modifications to domain trust settings, such as when a user or application modifies the federation settings on the domain.DS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor changes to cloud-based directory services and identity tenants, especially regarding the addition of new federated identity providers.
