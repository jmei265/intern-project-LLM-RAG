Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such asArchive Collected Data. Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality withincmdand bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.[1]In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary mayCreate Cloud Instanceand stage data in that instance.[2]Adversaries may choose to stage data from a victim network in a centralized location prior to Exfiltration to minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.ID:T1074Sub-techniques:T1074.001,T1074.002ⓘTactic:CollectionⓘPlatforms:IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSContributors:Praetorian; Shane Tully, @securitygypsyVersion:1.4Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:20 July 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1020KevinKevincan create directories to store logs and other collected data.[3]S0641KobalosKobaloscan write captured SSH connection credentials to a file under the/var/rundirectory with a.pidextension for exfiltration.[4]S1076QUIETCANARYQUIETCANARYhas the ability to stage data prior to exfiltration.[5]G1015Scattered SpiderScattered Spiderstages data in a centralized database prior to exfiltration.[6]S1019SharkSharkhas stored information in folders namedU1andU2prior to exfiltration.[7]G1017Volt TyphoonVolt Typhoonhas staged collected data in password-protected archives.[8]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas collected and staged credentials and network enumeration information, using  the networkdll and psfinTrickBotmodules.[9]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather and copy to a location. Data may also be acquired and staged through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.DS0022FileFile AccessMonitor processes that appear to be reading files from disparate locations and writing them to the same directory or file may be an indication of data being staged, especially if they are suspected of performing encryption or compression on the files, such as 7zip, RAR, ZIP, or zlib.File CreationMonitor publicly writeable directories, central locations, and commonly used staging directories (recycle bin, temp folders, etc.) to regularly check for compressed or encrypted data that may be indicative of staging.DS0024Windows RegistryWindows Registry Key ModificationConsider monitoring accesses and modifications to local storage repositories (such as the Windows Registry), especially from suspicious processes that could be related to malicious data collection.ReferencesPwC and BAE Systems.
