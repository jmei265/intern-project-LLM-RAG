XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (.desktop) to configure the user’s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.[1][2]Adversaries may abuse this feature to establish persistence by adding a path to a malicious binary or command to theExecdirective in the.desktopconfiguration file. When the user’s desktop environment is loaded at user login, the.desktopfiles located in the XDG Autostart directories are automatically executed. System-wide Autostart entries are located in the/etc/xdg/autostartdirectory while the user entries are located in the~/.config/autostartdirectory.Adversaries may combine this technique withMasqueradingto blend malicious Autostart entries with legitimate programs.[3]ID:T1547.013Sub-technique of:T1547ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:LinuxⓘPermissions Required:User, rootContributors:Tony Lambert, Red CanaryVersion:1.1Created:10 September 2019Last Modified:16 October 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0235CrossRATCrossRATcan use an XDG Autostart to establish persistence.[3]S0410FysbisIf executing without root privileges,Fysbisadds a.desktopconfiguration file to the user's~/.config/autostartdirectory.[3][4]S0198NETWIRENETWIREcan use XDG Autostart Entries to establish persistence on Linux systems.[5]S0192PupyPupycan use an XDG Autostart to establish persistence.[3]S1078RotaJakiroWhen executing with user-level permissions,RotaJakirocan install persistence using a .desktop file under the$HOME/.config/autostart/folder.[6]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1033Limit Software InstallationRestrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages.M1022Restrict File and Directory PermissionsRestrict write access to XDG autostart entries to only select privileged users.M1018User Account ManagementLimit privileges of user accounts so only authorized privileged users can create and modify XDG autostart entries.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may modify XDG autostart entries to execute programs or commands during system boot.DS0022FileFile CreationMalicious XDG autostart entries may be detected by auditing file creation events within the/etc/xdg/autostartand~/.config/autostartdirectories. Depending on individual configurations, defenders may need to query the environment variables$XDG_CONFIG_HOMEor$XDG_CONFIG_DIRSto determine the paths of Autostart entries. Autostart entry files not associated with legitimate packages may be considered suspicious. Suspicious entries can also be identified by comparing entries to a trusted system baseline.File ModificationMalicious XDG autostart entries may be detected by auditing file modification events within the/etc/xdg/autostartand~/.config/autostartdirectories.
