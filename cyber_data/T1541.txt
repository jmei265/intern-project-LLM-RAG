Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope.[1]Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using Android’sstartForeground()API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.[2]Malicious applications may abuse thestartForeground()API method to continue running in the foreground, while presenting a notification to the user pretending to be a genuine application. This would allow unhindered access to the device’s sensors, assuming permission has been previously granted.[3]Malicious applications may also abuse thestartForeground()API to inform the Android system that the user is actively interacting with the application, thus preventing it from being killed by the low memory killer.[4]ID:T1541Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactics:Defense Evasion,PersistenceⓘPlatforms:AndroidⓘMTC ID:APP-19Contributors:Lorin Wu, Trend MicroVersion:2.1Created:19 November 2019Last Modified:20 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1054DrinikDrinikhas C2 commands that can move the malware in and out of the foreground.[5]S0485MandrakeMandrakeuses foreground persistence to keep a service running.
