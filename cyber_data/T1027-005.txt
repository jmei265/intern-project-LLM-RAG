They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use the malware.ID:T1027.005Sub-technique of:T1027ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘDefense Bypassed:Anti-virus, Host intrusion prevention systems, Log analysis, Signature-based detectionVersion:1.1Created:19 March 2020Last Modified:28 April 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3APT3has been known to remove indicators of compromise from tools.[1]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikeincludes a capability to modify the Beacon payload to eliminate known signatures or unpacking methods.[2][3]S0187DaserfAnalysis ofDaserfhas shown that it regularly undergoes technical improvements to evade anti-virus detection.[4]G0009Deep PandaDeep Pandahas updated and modified its malware, resulting in different hash values that evade detection.[5]G0093GALLIUMGALLIUMensured each payload had a unique hash, including by using different types of packers.[6]S0237GravityRATThe author ofGravityRATsubmitted samples to VirusTotal for testing, showing that the author modified the code to try to hide the DDE object in a different part of the document.[7]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolehas undergone regular technical improvements in an attempt to evade detection.[8]G0049OilRigOilRighas tested malware samples to determine AV detection and subsequently modified the samples to ensure AV evasion.[9][10]C0014Operation WocaoDuringOperation Wocao, threat actors edited variable names within theImpacketsuite to avoid automated detection.[11]G0040PatchworkPatchworkapparently alteredNDiskMonitorsamples by adding four bytes of random letters in a likely attempt to change the file hashes.[12]S0587PenquinPenquincan remove strings from binaries.[13]S0194PowerSploitPowerSploit'sFind-AVSignatureAntivirusBypass module can be used to locate single byte anti-virus signatures.[14][15]S0650QakBotQakBotcan make small changes to itself in order to change its checksum and hash value.[16][17]S0559SUNBURSTSUNBURSTsource code used generic variable names and pre-obfuscated strings, and was likely sanitized of developer comments before being added toSUNSPOT.[18]C0030Triton Safety Instrumented System AttackIn theTriton Safety Instrumented System Attack,TEMP.Velesmodified files based on the open-source project cryptcat in an apparent attempt to decrease anti-virus detection rates.[19]G0010TurlaBased on comparison ofGazerversions,Turlamade an effort to obfuscate strings in the malware that could be used as IoCs, including the mutex name and named pipe.[20]S0579WaterbearWaterbearcan scramble functions not to be executed again with random values.[21]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Similar events may also occur at the boundary through network IDS, email scanning appliance, etc. The initial detection should be treated as an indication of a potentially more invasive intrusion. The alerting system should be thoroughly investigated beyond that initial alert for activity that was not detected. Adversaries may continue with an operation, assuming that individual events like an anti-virus detect will not be investigated or that an analyst will not be able to conclusively link that event to other activity occurring on the network.ReferencesKorban, C, et al.
