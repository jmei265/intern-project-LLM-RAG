Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems.Remote Service Session Hijackingdiffers from use ofRemote Servicesbecause it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session usingValid Accounts.[1][2]ID:T1563Sub-techniques:T1563.001,T1563.002ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:25 February 2020Last Modified:26 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramDisable the remote service (ex: SSH, RDP, etc.) if it is unnecessary.M1030Network SegmentationEnable firewall rules to block unnecessary traffic between network security zones within a network.M1027Password PoliciesSet and enforce secure password policies for accounts.M1026Privileged Account ManagementDo not allow remote access to services as a privileged account unless necessary.M1018User Account ManagementLimit remote user permissions if remote access is necessary.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.DS0028Logon SessionLogon Session CreationMonitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.DS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor newly executed processes that may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.ReferencesBeaumont, K.
