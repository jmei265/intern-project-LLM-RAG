The adversary may then perform management actions or access cloud-hosted resources as the logged-on user.Many enterprises federate centrally managed user identities to cloud services, allowing users to login with their domain credentials in order to access the cloud control plane. Similarly, adversaries may connect to available cloud services through the web console or through the cloud command line interface (CLI) (e.g.,Cloud API), using commands such asConnect-AZAccountfor Azure PowerShell,Connect-MgGraphfor Microsoft Graph PowerShell, andgcloud auth loginfor the Google Cloud CLI.In some cases, adversaries may be able to authenticate to these services viaApplication Access Tokeninstead of a username and password.ID:T1021.007Sub-technique of:T1021ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaSVersion:1.0Created:21 February 2023Last Modified:14 April 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0016APT29APT29has leveraged compromised high-privileged on-premises accounts synced to Office 365 to move laterally into a cloud environment, including through the use of Azure AD PowerShell.[1]C0027C0027DuringC0027,Scattered Spiderused compromised Azure credentials for credential theft activity and lateral movement to on-premises systems.[2]G1015Scattered SpiderDuringC0027,Scattered Spiderused compromised Azure credentials for credential theft activity and lateral movement to on-premises systems.[2]Scattered Spider has also leveraged pre-existing AWS EC2 instances for lateral movement and data collection purposes.[3]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication on cloud services whenever possible.M1026Privileged Account ManagementLimit the number of high-privileged domain and cloud accounts, and ensure that these are not used for day-to-day operations.
