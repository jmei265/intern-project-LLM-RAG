Created email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex:Domains).[1]To decrease the chance of physically tying back operations to themselves, adversaries may make use of disposable email services.[3]ID:T1585.002Sub-technique of:T1585ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.1Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:28 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0006APT1APT1has created email accounts for later use in social engineering, phishing, and when registering domains.[1]G1011EXOTIC LILYEXOTIC LILYhas created e-mail accounts to spoof targeted organizations.[4]C0007FunnyDreamForFunnyDream, the threat actors likely established an identified email account to register a variety of domains that were used during the campaign.[5]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas established email accounts for use in domain registration including for ProtonMail addresses.[6]G0119Indrik SpiderIndrik Spiderhas created email accounts to communicate with their ransomware victims, to include providing payment and decryption details.[7]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas created email accounts for phishing operations.[8]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas created new email accounts for spearphishing operations.[9]G0065LeviathanLeviathanhas created new email accounts for targeting efforts.[10]G0059Magic HoundMagic Houndhas established email accounts using fake personas for spearphishing operations.[11][12]G0129Mustang PandaMustang Pandahas leveraged the legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go for phishing campaigns.[13]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupcreated fake email accounts to correspond with fake LinkedIn personas;Lazarus Groupalso established email accounts to match those of the victim as part of their BEC attempt.[14]C0016Operation Dust StormForOperation Dust Storm, the threat actors established email addresses to register domains for their operations.[15]C0006Operation HoneybeeDuringOperation Honeybee, attackers created email addresses to register for a free account for a control server used for the implants.[16]C0014Operation WocaoForOperation Wocao, the threat actors registered email accounts to use during the campaign.[17]G0034Sandworm TeamSandworm Teamhas created email accounts that mimic legitimate organizations for its spearphishing operations.[18]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas established e-mail accounts to receive e-mails forwarded from compromised accounts.[19]G0102Wizard SpiderWizard Spiderhas leveraged ProtonMail email addresses in ransom notes when deliveringRyukransomware.[20]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionMuch of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult.
