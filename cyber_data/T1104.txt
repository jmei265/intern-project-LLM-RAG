Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions. The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files. A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks orFallback Channelsin case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.ID:T1104Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:14 July 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0022APT3AnAPT3downloader first establishes a SOCKS5 connection to 192.157.198[.]103 using TCP port 1913; once the server response is verified, it then requests a connection to 192.184.60[.]229 on TCP port 81.[1]G0096APT41APT41used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor.[2]S0031BACKSPACEBACKSPACEattempts to avoid detection by checking a first stage command and control server to determine if it should connect to the second stage server, which performs "louder" interactions with the malware.[3]S0534BazarTheBazarloader is used to download and execute theBazarbackdoor.[4][5]S0069BLACKCOFFEEBLACKCOFFEEuses Microsoft’s TechNet Web portal to obtain an encoded tag containing the IP address of a command and control server and then communicates separately with that IP address for C2.
