VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB ("remote framebuffer") protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.[1]VNC differs fromRemote Desktop Protocolas VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.[2][3]Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.[4][5][6][7][8][9]ID:T1021.005Sub-technique of:T1021ⓘTactic:Lateral MovementⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘSystem Requirements:VNC server installed and listening for connections.Version:1.1Created:11 February 2020Last Modified:30 March 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0484CarberpCarberpcan start a remote VNC session by downloading a new plugin.[10]S1014DanBotDanBotcan use VNC for remote access to targeted systems.[11]G0046FIN7FIN7has used TightVNC to control compromised hosts.[12]G0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas installed TightVNC server and client on compromised servers and endpoints for lateral movement.[13]G0047Gamaredon GroupGamaredon Grouphas used VNC tools, including UltraVNC, to remotely interact with compromised hosts.[14][15][16]G0036GCMANGCMANuses VNC for lateral movement.[17]S0279ProtonProtonuses VNC to connect into systems.[18]S0266TrickBotTrickBothas used a VNC module to monitor the victim and collect information to pivot to valuable systems on the network[19][20]S0670WarzoneRATWarzoneRAThas the ability of performing remote desktop access via a VNC console.[21]S0412ZxShellZxShellsupports functionality for VNC sessions.[22]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditInventory workstations for unauthorized VNC server software.M1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramUninstall any VNC server software where not required.M1037Filter Network TrafficVNC defaults to TCP ports 5900 for the server, 5800 for browser access, and 5500 for a viewer in listening mode. Filtering or blocking these ports will inhibit VNC traffic utilizing default ports.M1033Limit Software InstallationRestrict software installation to user groups that require it.
