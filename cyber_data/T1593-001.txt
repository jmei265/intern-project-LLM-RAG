Social media sites may contain various information about a victim organization, such as business announcements as well as information about the roles, locations, and interests of staff.Adversaries may search in different social media sites depending on what information they seek to gather. Threat actors may passively harvest data from these sites, as well as use information gathered to create fake profiles/groups to elicit victim’s into revealing specific information (i.e.Spearphishing Service).[1]Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:Phishing for InformationorSearch Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex:Establish AccountsorCompromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex:Spearphishing via Service).ID:T1593.001Sub-technique of:T1593ⓘTactic:ReconnaissanceⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.0Created:02 October 2020Last Modified:15 April 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG1011EXOTIC LILYEXOTIC LILYhas copied data from social media sites to impersonate targeted individuals.[2]G0094KimsukyKimsukyhas used Twitter to monitor potential victims and to prepare targeted phishing e-mails.[3]C0022Operation Dream JobForOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupused LinkedIn to identify and target employees within a chosen organization.[4]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
