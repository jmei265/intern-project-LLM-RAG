Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon.[1][2][3][4][5]These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.Since some boot or logon autostart programs run with higher privileges, an adversary may leverage these to elevate privileges.ID:T1547Sub-techniques:T1547.001,T1547.002,T1547.003,T1547.004,T1547.005,T1547.006,T1547.007,T1547.008,T1547.009,T1547.010,T1547.012,T1547.013,T1547.014,T1547.015ⓘTactics:Persistence,Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:Administrator, User, rootVersion:1.2Created:23 January 2020Last Modified:16 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0651BoxCaonBoxCaonestablished persistence by setting theHKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\loadregistry key to point to its executable.[6]S0567DtrackDtrack’s RAT makes a persistent target file with auto execution on the host start.[7]S0084Mis-TypeMis-Typehas created registry keys for persistence, includingHKCU\Software\bkfouerioyou,HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{6afa8072-b2b1-31a8-b5c1-{Unique Identifier}, andHKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{3BF41072-B2B1-31A8-B5C1-{Unique Identifier}.[8]S0083MisdatMisdathas created registry keys for persistence, includingHKCU\Software\dnimtsoleht\StubPath,HKCU\Software\snimtsOleht\StubPath,HKCU\Software\Backtsaleht\StubPath,HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed.
