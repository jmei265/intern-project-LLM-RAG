Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a non-standard data encoding system that diverges from existing protocol specifications. Non-standard data encoding schemes may be based on or related to standard data encoding schemes, such as a modified Base64 encoding for the message body of an HTTP request.[1][2]ID:T1132.002Sub-technique of:T1132ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSⓘPermissions Required:UserVersion:1.0Created:14 March 2020Last Modified:14 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0031BACKSPACENewer variants ofBACKSPACEwill encode C2 communications with a custom system.[3]S0239BankshotBankshotencodes commands from the control server using a range of characters and gzip.[4]S0687Cyclops BlinkCyclops Blinkcan use a custom binary scheme to encode messages with specific commands and parameters to be executed.[5]S0260InvisiMoleInvisiMolecan use a modified base32 encoding to encode data within the subdomain of C2 requests.[6]S1090NightClubNightClubhas used a non-standard encoding in DNS tunneling removing any=from the result of base64 encoding, and replacing/characters with-sand+characters with-p.[7]S1100NinjaNinjacan encode C2 communications with a base64 algorithm using a custom alphabet.[8]S0346OceanSaltOceanSaltcan encode data with a NOT operation before sending the data to the control server.[9]S1046PowGoopPowGoopcan use a modified Base64 encoding mechanism to send data to and from the C2 server.[10]S0495RDATRDATcan communicate with the C2 via subdomains that utilize base64 with character substitutions.[11]S0596ShadowPadShadowPadhas encoded data as readable Latin characters.[12]S1035Small SieveSmall Sievecan use a custom hex byte swapping encoding scheme to obfuscate tasking traffic.[13][14]S0022UroburosUroburoscan use a custom base62 and a de-facto base32 encoding that uses digits 0-9 and lowercase letters a-z in C2 communications.[15]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1031Network Intrusion PreventionNetwork intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level. Signatures are often for unique indicators within protocols and may be based on the specific obfuscation technique used by a particular adversary or tool, and will likely be different across various malware families and versions. Adversaries will likely change tool C2 signatures over time or construct protocols in such a way as to avoid detection by common defensive tools.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor for network data for uncommon data flows (e.g., a client sending significantly more data than it receives from a server). Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious. Analyze packet contents to detect communications that do not follow the expected protocol behavior for the port that is being used.ReferencesWikipedia. (2016, December 26). Binary-to-text encoding.
