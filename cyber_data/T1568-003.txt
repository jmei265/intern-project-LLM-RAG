A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.[1]One implementation ofDNS Calculationis to take the first three octets of an IP address in a DNS response and use those values to calculate the port for command and control traffic.[1][2][3]ID:T1568.003Sub-technique of:T1568ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Windows, macOSVersion:1.0Created:11 March 2020Last Modified:27 March 2020Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0005APT12APT12has used multiple variants ofDNS Calculationincluding multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value in order to get a resulting command and control port.[1]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since

Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).ReferencesMeyers, A.
