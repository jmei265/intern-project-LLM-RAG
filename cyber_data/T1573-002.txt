Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified asAsymmetric Cryptography.ID:T1573.002Sub-technique of:T1573ⓘTactic:Command and ControlⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSVersion:1.1Created:16 March 2020Last Modified:26 December 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS0202adbupdadbupdcontains a copy of the OpenSSL library to encrypt C2 traffic.[1]S0045ADVSTORESHELLA variant ofADVSTORESHELLencrypts some C2 with RSA.[2]S0438AttorAttor's Blowfish key is encrypted with a public RSA key.[3]S1081BADHATCHBADHATCHcan beacon to a hardcoded C2 IP address using TLS encryption every 5 minutes.[4]S0534BazarBazarcan use TLS in C2 communications.[5]S0017BISCUITBISCUITuses SSL for encrypting C2 communications.[6]C0021C0021DuringC0021, the threat actors used SSL via TCP port 443 for C2 communications.[7]S0335CarbonCarbonhas used RSA encryption for C2 communications.[8]S0023CHOPSTICKCHOPSTICKencrypts C2 communications with TLS.[9]S1105COATHANGERCOATHANGERconnects to command and control infrastructure using SSL.[10]G0080Cobalt GroupCobalt Grouphas used the Plink utility to create SSH tunnels.[11]S0154Cobalt StrikeCobalt Strikecan use RSA asymmetric encryption with PKCS1 padding to encrypt data sent to the C2 server.[12]S0126ComRATComRATcan use SSL/TLS encryption for its HTTP-based C2 channel.ComRAThas used public key cryptography with RSA and AES encrypted email attachments for its Gmail C2 channel.[13][14]S0687Cyclops BlinkCyclops Blinkcan encrypt C2 messages with AES-256-CBC sent underneath TLS.
