Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in an application, service, within the operating system software, or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructions, such as permission levels, will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques. Adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.When initially gaining access to a device, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and applications running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user- level permission to root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable.ID:T1404Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesTactic Type:Post-Adversary Device AccessⓘTactic:Privilege EscalationⓘPlatforms:Android, iOSⓘMTC ID:APP-26Version:2.1Created:25 October 2017Last Modified:08 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionS1061AbstractEmuAbstractEmucan use rooting exploits to silently give itself permissions or install additional malware.[1]S0440Agent SmithAgent Smithexploits known OS vulnerabilities, including Janus, to replace legitimate applications with malicious versions.[2]S0293BrainTestSome original variants ofBrainTesthad the capability to automatically root some devices, but that behavior was not observed in later samples.[3]S0550DoubleAgentDoubleAgenthas used exploit tools to gain root, such as TowelRoot.[4]S0420DvmapDvmapattempts to gain root access by using local exploits.[5]S0405ExodusExodusTwo attempts to elevate privileges by using a modified version of the DirtyCow exploit.[6]S0182FinFisherFinFishercomes packaged with ExynosAbuse, an Android exploit that can gain root privileges.[7]S0290GooliganGooliganexecutes Android root exploits.[8]S0322HummingBadHummingBadcan exploit unfixed vulnerabilities in older Android versions to root victim phones.[9]S0463INSOMNIAINSOMNIAexploits a WebKit vulnerability to achieve root access on the device.[10]S0316Pegasus for AndroidPegasus for Androidattempts to exploit well-known Android OS vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.[11]S0289Pegasus for iOSPegasus for iOSexploits iOS vulnerabilities to escalate privileges.[12]S1126PhenakitePhenakitehas included exploits for jailbreaking infected devices.[13]S0294ShiftyBugShiftyBugis packed with at least eight publicly available exploits that can perform rooting.[14]S0327SkygofreeSkygofreehas the capability to exploit several known vulnerabilities and escalate privileges.[15]S0324SpyDealerSpyDealeruses the commercial rooting app Baidu Easy Root to gain root privilege and maintain persistence on the victim.[16]S0494ZenZencan obtain root access via a rooting trojan in its infection chain.[17]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1002AttestationDevice attestation can often detect jailbroken or rooted devices.M1010Deploy Compromised Device Detection MethodMobile security products can potentially detect jailbroken or rooted devices.M1001Security UpdatesSecurity updates often contain patches for vulnerabilities.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0041Application VettingAPI CallsApplication vetting services could potentially determine if an application contains code designed to exploit vulnerabilities.DS0013Sensor HealthHost StatusMobile security products can potentially utilize device APIs to determine if a device has been rooted or jailbroken.ReferencesP Shunk, K Balaam.
