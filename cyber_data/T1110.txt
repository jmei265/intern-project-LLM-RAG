For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access toValid Accountswithin a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such asOS Credential Dumping,Account Discovery, orPassword Policy Discovery. Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such asExternal Remote Servicesas part of Initial Access.ID:T1110Sub-techniques:T1110.001,T1110.002,T1110.003,T1110.004ⓘTactic:Credential AccessⓘPlatforms:Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOSContributors:Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; David Fiser, @anu4is, Trend Micro; Ed Williams, Trustwave, SpiderLabs; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Mohamed Kmal; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:2.5Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:29 January 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionC00252016 Ukraine Electric Power AttackDuring the2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack,Sandworm Teamused a script to attempt RPC authentication against a number of hosts.[2]G0007APT28APT28can perform brute force attacks to obtain credentials.[3][1][4]G0082APT38APT38has used brute force techniques to attempt account access when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are unavailable.[5]G0087APT39APT39has used Ncrack to reveal credentials.[6]S0572Caterpillar WebShellCaterpillar WebShellhas a module to perform brute force attacks on a system.[7]S0220ChaosChaosconducts brute force attacks against SSH services to gain initial access.[8]S0488CrackMapExecCrackMapExeccan brute force supplied user credentials across a network range.[9]G0105DarkVishnyaDarkVishnyaused brute-force attack to obtain login data.[10]G0035DragonflyDragonflyhas attempted to brute force credentials to gain access.[11]G0053FIN5FIN5has has used the tool GET2 Penetrator to look for remote login and hard-coded credentials.[12][13]G0117Fox KittenFox Kittenhas brute forced RDP credentials.[14]G1001HEXANEHEXANEhas used brute force attacks to compromise valid credentials.[15]S0599KinsingKinsinghas attempted to brute force hosts over SSH.[16]G0049OilRigOilRighas used brute force techniques to obtain credentials.[17]C0022Operation Dream JobDuringOperation Dream Job,Lazarus Groupperformed brute force attacks against administrator accounts.[18]S0378PoshC2PoshC2has modules for brute forcing local administrator and AD user accounts.[19]S0583PysaPysahas used brute force attempts against a central management console, as well as some Active Directory accounts.[20]S0650QakBotQakBotcan conduct brute force attacks to capture credentials.[21][22][23]G0010TurlaTurlamay attempt to connect to systems within a victim's network usingnet usecommands and a predefined list or collection of passwords.[24]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1036Account Use PoliciesSet account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out. Use conditional access policies to block logins from non-compliant devices or from outside defined organization IP ranges.[25]M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication. Where possible, also enable multi-factor authentication on externally facing services.M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[26]M1018User Account ManagementProactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0015Application LogApplication Log ContentMonitor authentication logs for system and application login failures ofValid Accounts. If authentication failures are high, then there may be a brute force attempt to gain access to a system using legitimate credentials.DS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments that may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.DS0002User AccountUser Account AuthenticationMonitor for many failed authentication attempts across various accounts that may result from password spraying attempts. It is difficult to detect when hashes are cracked, since this is generally done outside the scope of the target network.ReferencesHacquebord, F., Remorin, L. (2020, December 17).
