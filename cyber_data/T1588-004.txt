SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.Adversaries may purchase or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex:Asymmetric CryptographywithWeb Protocols) or even enablingAdversary-in-the-Middleif the certificate is trusted or otherwise added to the root of trust (i.e.Install Root Certificate). The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities.[1]Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.Certificate authorities exist that allow adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates, such as domain validation certificates, for free.[2]After obtaining a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (seeInstall Digital Certificate) on infrastructure under their control.ID:T1588.004Sub-technique of:T1588ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREVersion:1.2Created:01 October 2020Last Modified:16 October 2021Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0098BlackTechBlackTechhas used valid, stolen digital certificates for some of their malware and tools.[3]G0032Lazarus GroupLazarus Grouphas obtained SSL certificates for their C2 domains.[4]G1014LuminousMothLuminousMothhas used a valid digital certificate for some of their malware.[5]C0006Operation HoneybeeForOperation Honeybee, the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to use with their MaoCheng dropper.[6]G0122Silent LibrarianSilent Librarianhas obtained free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for use on their phishing pages.[7][8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0037CertificateCertificate RegistrationConsider use of services that may aid in the tracking of newly issued certificates and/or certificates in use on sites across the Internet. In some cases it may be possible to pivot on known pieces of certificate information to uncover other adversary infrastructure.[9]Some server-side components of adversary tools may have default values set for SSL/TLS certificates.[10]DS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentMonitor for logged network traffic in response to a scan showing both protocol header and body values that may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting.
