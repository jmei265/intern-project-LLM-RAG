There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering.[1][2][3][4]These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.ID:T1127Sub-techniques:T1127.001ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:WindowsⓘDefense Bypassed:Application ControlContributors:Casey Smith; Matthew Demaske, AdaptforwardVersion:1.2Created:31 May 2017Last Modified:05 May 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1042Disable or Remove Feature or ProgramSpecific developer utilities may not be necessary within a given environment and should be removed if not used.M1038Execution PreventionCertain developer utilities should be blocked or restricted if not required.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor executed commands and arguments used before and after invocation of the utilities may also be useful in determining the origin and purpose of the binary being executed.DS0009ProcessProcess CreationMonitor for abnormal presence of these or other utilities that enable proxy execution that are typically used for development, debugging, and reverse engineering on a system that is not used for these purposes may be suspicious. Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of from developer utilities that may be abused. Compare recent invocations of those binaries with prior history of known good arguments and executed binaries to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. It is likely that these utilities will be used by software developers or for other software development related tasks, so if it exists and is used outside of that context, then the event may be suspicious.ReferencesNelson, M.
