Network devices, such as small office/home office (SOHO) routers, may be compromised where the adversary's ultimate goal is notInitial Accessto that environment -- instead leveraging these devices to support additional targeting.Once an adversary has control, compromised network devices can be used to launch additional operations, such as hosting payloads forPhishingcampaigns (i.e.,Link Target) or enabling the required access to executeContent Injectionoperations. Adversaries may also be able to harvest reusable credentials (i.e.,Valid Accounts) from compromised network devices.Adversaries often target Internet-facing edge devices and related network appliances that specifically do not support robust host-based defenses.[1][2]Compromised network devices may be used to support subsequentCommand and Controlactivity, such asHide Infrastructurethrough an establishedProxyand/orBotnetnetwork.[3]ID:T1584.008Sub-technique of:T1584ⓘTactic:Resource DevelopmentⓘPlatforms:PREContributors:Gavin KnappVersion:1.0Created:28 March 2024Last Modified:19 April 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0007APT28APT28compromised Ubiquiti network devices to act as collection devices for credentials compromised via phishing webpages.[4]C0029Cutting EdgeDuringCutting Edge, threat actors used compromised and out-of-support Cyberoam VPN appliances for C2.[5][6]G1017Volt TyphoonVolt Typhoonhas compromised small office and home office (SOHO) network edge devices, many of which were located in the same geographic area as the victim, to proxy network traffic.[7][8]MitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1056Pre-compromiseThis technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0035Internet ScanResponse ContentOnce adversaries leverage compromised network devices as infrastructure (ex: for command and control), it may be possible to look for unique characteristics associated with adversary software, if known.[9]Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult. Detection efforts may be focused on related stages of the adversary lifecycle.ReferencesMarvi, A. et al.. (2023, March 16).
