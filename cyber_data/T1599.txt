Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.  Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.  To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control viaMulti-hop Proxyor exfiltration of data viaTraffic Duplication. Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction withInternal Proxyto achieve the same goals.[1]In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments.ID:T1599Sub-techniques:T1599.001ⓘTactic:Defense EvasionⓘPlatforms:NetworkⓘDefense Bypassed:Firewall, System Access ControlsVersion:1.1Created:19 October 2020Last Modified:05 May 2022Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1043Credential Access ProtectionSome embedded network devices are capable of storing passwords for local accounts in either plain-text or encrypted formats.  Ensure that, where available, local passwords are always encrypted, per vendor recommendations.[2]M1037Filter Network TrafficUpon identifying a compromised network device being used to bridge a network boundary, block the malicious packets using an unaffected network device in path, such as a firewall or a router that has not been compromised.  Continue to monitor for additional activity and to ensure that the blocks are indeed effective.M1032Multi-factor AuthenticationUse multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts. Most embedded network devices support TACACS+ and/or RADIUS.  Follow vendor prescribed best practices for hardening access control.[3]M1027Password PoliciesRefer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies.[4]M1026Privileged Account ManagementRestrict administrator accounts to as few individuals as possible, following least privilege principles.  Prevent credential overlap across systems of administrator and privileged accounts, particularly between network and non-network platforms, such as servers or endpoints.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0029Network TrafficNetwork Traffic ContentMonitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure). Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).Network Traffic FlowMonitor network data for uncommon data flows. Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.ReferencesVyacheslav Kopeytsev and Seongsu Park. (2021, February 25).
