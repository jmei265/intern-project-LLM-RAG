When a computer enters a dormant state, some or all software and hardware may cease to operate which can disrupt malicious activity.[1]Adversaries may abuse system utilities and configuration settings to maintain access by preventing machines from entering a state, such as standby, that can terminate malicious activity.[2][3]For example,powercfgcontrols all configurable power system settings on a Windows system and can be abused to prevent an infected host from locking or shutting down.[4]Adversaries may also extend system lock screen timeout settings.[5]Other relevant settings, such as disk and hibernate timeout, can be similarly abused to keep the infected machine running even if no user is active.[6]Aware that some malware cannot survive system reboots, adversaries may entirely delete files used to invoke system shut down or reboot.[7]ID:T1653Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:PersistenceⓘPlatforms:Linux, Network, Windows, macOSContributors:Goldstein Menachem; Juan TapiadorVersion:1.0Created:05 June 2023Last Modified:30 September 2023Version PermalinkLive VersionMitigationsIDMitigationDescriptionM1047AuditPeriodically inspect systems for abnormal and unexpected power settings that may indicate malicious activty.DetectionIDData SourceData ComponentDetectsDS0017CommandCommand ExecutionMonitor and inspect commands and arguments associated with manipulating the power settings of a system.DS0022FileFile ModificationMonitor for unexpected changes to configuration files associated with the power settings of a system.ReferencesAVG.
