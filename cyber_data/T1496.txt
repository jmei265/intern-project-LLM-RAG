Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.[1]Servers and cloud-based systems are common targets because of the high potential for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.[2]Containerized environments may also be targeted due to the ease of deployment via exposed APIs and the potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple containers within an environment or cluster.[3][4]Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure it’s not competing for resources.[5]Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitateNetwork Denial of Servicecampaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents.[6]Alternatively, they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network bandwidth and IP address to proxyware services.[7]ID:T1496Sub-techniques:No sub-techniquesⓘTactic:ImpactⓘPlatforms:Containers, IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOSⓘImpact Type:AvailabilityContributors:Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; David Fiser, @anu4is, Trend Micro; Goldstein Menachem; Jay Chen, Palo Alto Networks; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research TeamVersion:1.5Created:17 April 2019Last Modified:14 February 2024Version PermalinkLive VersionProcedure ExamplesIDNameDescriptionG0096APT41APT41deployed a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool in a victim’s environment.[8]G0108Blue MockingbirdBlue Mockingbirdhas used XMRIG to mine cryptocurrency on victim systems.[9]S0486BonadanBonadancan download an additional module which has a cryptocurrency mining extension.[10]S0492CookieMinerCookieMinerhas loaded coinmining software onto systems to mine for Koto cryptocurrency.[11]S1111DarkGateDarkGatecan deploy follow-on cryptocurrency mining payloads.[12]S0601HildegardHildegardhas used xmrig to mine cryptocurrency.[3]S0434Imminent MonitorImminent Monitorhas the capability to run a cryptocurrency miner on the victim machine.[13]S0599KinsingKinsinghas created and run a Bitcoin cryptocurrency miner.[14][15]S0451LoudMinerLoudMinerharvested system resources to mine cryptocurrency, using XMRig to mine Monero.[16]S0532LuciferLucifercan use system resources to mine cryptocurrency, dropping XMRig to mine Monero.[17]G0106RockeRockehas distributed cryptomining malware.[18][19]S0468SkidmapSkidmapis a kernel-mode rootkit used for cryptocurrency mining.[20]G0139TeamTNTTeamTNThas deployed XMRig Docker images to mine cryptocurrency.[21][22]TeamTNThas also infected Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters with XMRig, and used RainbowMiner and lolMiner for mining cryptocurrency.[23]MitigationsThis type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since
